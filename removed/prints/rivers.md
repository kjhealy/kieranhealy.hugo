Every stream, river, lake, and waterway in the United States, rendered in black and white. Data are from the USGS Hydrological Map layer. Available as a [framed](https://society6.com/product/american-rivers-streams-and-waterways2644099_framed-print?sku=s6-13429882p21a12v60a13v54) or [unframed](https://society6.com/product/american-rivers-streams-and-waterways2644099_print?sku=s6-13429882p4a1v45) print or a super-cool [metal print](https://society6.com/product/american-rivers-streams-and-waterways2644099_metal-print?sku=s6-13429882p54a71v499). Looks best in large sizes. The version shown here is highly compressed in order to not take all day loading on the page. The actual image is substantially sharper, as shown in this detail.

The metal print option works particularly well for this image.
