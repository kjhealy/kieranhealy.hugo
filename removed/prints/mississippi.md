Every stream, river, lake, and waterway within the drainage basin of the Mississippi-Missouri system, rendered in black and white. Data are from the USGS Hydrological Map layer. Available as a [framed](https://society6.com/product/the-mississippi-missouri-ohio-basin_framed-print?sku=s6-13457102p21a12v65a13v54) or [unframed](https://society6.com/product/the-mississippi-missouri-ohio-basin_print?sku=s6-13457102p4a1v45) print or a super-cool [metal print](https://society6.com/product/the-mississippi-missouri-ohio-basin_metal-print?sku=s6-13457102p54a71v503).

The metal print option works especially well for this image.
