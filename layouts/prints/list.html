  <p>Since I started working on data visualization, I've had several requests for copies of the images that I use when teaching people how to use R and ggplot. I typically make the R code for the images available on <a href="https://github.com/kjhealy">my GitHub page</a>, but getting things printed on good-quality paper or other media can be a pain. With that in mind, this page has a selection of visualizations with links to a <a href="https://society6.com/kjhealy">Society6</a> store where you can buy framed or unframed prints and posters of them. I've mostly used this for myself in the past when I wanted a version of an image to put up in my office, but printed on something other than either ordinary printer paper or a glossy conference poster. The Society6 people do a decent job. The paper stock for the art prints is a smooth matte cotton rag that's acid free. The printing is a giclée process (read: fancy inkjet) so each one is made to order. Depending on the geometry of the print, sizes range from 10x7 to 40x28. Most of the prints look better at larger sizes, especially the maps. For some of the images, there's also an option to print on a thin sheet of aluminum. This makes for a bright, high-detail image. Once again, the map images (both the rivers and the city maps) look very good on this surface—better in their fine detail than the matte art prints.</p>
