Entrepreneurs have been very much present throughout the history of
organ transplantation. This is partly due to the well-known failure of
the supply of organs to meet demand for them, a circumstance that
generally produces pressure for some sort of creative response. But
our interest in the case goes beyond this. The history of innovation
in organ transplantation is, of course, partly one of medical advances
and technical developments that have made it possible—even routine—to
safely remove a kidney from one person and put it in someone else. But
it has also been a history of active exploration, innovation, and
management of a potentially very controversial exchange at the
seemingly clear boundaries that separate giving from selling, life
from death, and right from wrong. Traffic across these boundaries, and
experimentation with its form and scope, has been a feature of organ
exchange since its earliest days. It has partly been a *cultural
process*, with transplant innovators actively exploring what people
will or will not tolerate when it comes to transferring goods or
providing services under potentially controversial circumstances. It
has partly been an *organizational problem*, as participants
experimented with the logistical infrastructure necessary to
accomplish the needed exchanges in some desired form. And it has also
presented a *legal challenge*, as the entrepreneurs developing methods
and rules of exchange have carried out their innovations in the shadow
of the law. This has meant managing constraints or avoiding penalties
imposed by legal requirements, and navigating legal obstacles that
have sometimes proved to be real, and sometimes imagined.
