<h2><em>The Ordinal Society</em> is an argument about how digital capitalism is reformatting the world</h2>

</br />

Over the past fifty years, changes in the scope of social data collection and analysis have radically reorganized how we experience and make our lives. Much of what we do is now immediately authenticated, recorded, classified, and scored on some sort of scale. We live in an ordinal society, a society oriented toward, justified by, and governed through measurement.

How did this happen? Information technology gave us the means to grasp the totality of people’s lives in the form of discrete, standardized units of information. It fed on an abundance of personal data emitted by ever smaller and more powerful computing devices that ended up first in the homes, then on the laps, and then in the hands of billions of people. The networked structure of the World Wide Web scaled up and amplified this process. Some of this data was exfiltrated covertly, but much of it was freely and even eagerly given out of hopefulness, convenience, or sociality. Managers and financiers became convinced of its usefulness and started to chase after it. 

The increasing capacity to frame and use this data has reorganized markets, the state, and social life in general. Methods for analyzing it are by now everywhere. They streamline and automate processes of risk prediction, resource allocation, communication, and decision-making. Sometimes these methods are plausible and precise; sometimes they are opaque and even absurd. But either way, they group and stratify people in ways that are both highly individualized and flexibly differentiated according to the demands of particular settings. We cannot escape this process; in fact, we count on it. In domain after domain, it is changing the overall distribution of opportunity, the everyday experience of status, and the nature of economic competition. In its wake, our moral intuitions about merit and personal worth are changing too.

Even when the data is bad, or the analytical results are spurious, the outcome is a form of rationalized stratification. It is not that everyone is simply reduced to a faceless number. Rather, the ebb and flow of social and economic life is expressed by and managed through measurement. An ordinal society creates order through automated ranking and matching. The apparent power of its methods justifies the ostensible rightness of its hierarchies and categories. Interaction and exchange are built around a flow of personally tailored, data-driven possibilities. For people who are “well classified,” the results are often quite gratifying and carry a sense that what is personally convenient is also somehow morally correct. For those who are not, the outcomes can be more punitive, but are no less moralized.

That is the social form we seek to understand in this book.
