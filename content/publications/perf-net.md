The "performativity thesis" is the claim that parts
of contemporary economics and finance, when carried out into the world
by professionals and popularizers, reformat and reorganize the phenomena
they purport to describe, in ways that bring the world into line with
theory. Practical technologies, calculative devices and portable
algorithms give actors tools to implement particular models of action. I
argue that social network analysis is performative in the same sense as
the cases studied in this literature. Social network analysis and
finance theory are similar in key aspects of their development and
effects. For the case of economics, evidence for weaker versions of the
performativity thesis in quite good, and the strong formulation is
circumstantially supported. Network theory easily meets the evidential
threshold for the weaker versions; I offer empirical examples that
support the strong (or "Barnesian") formulation. Whether these
parallels are a mark in favor of the thesis or a strike against it is an
open question. I argue that the social network technologies and models
now being "performed" build out systems of generalized reciprocity,
connectivity, and commons-based production. This is in contrast both to
an earlier network imagery that emphasized self-interest and
entrepreneurial exploitation of structural opportunities, and to the
model of action typically considered to be performed by economic
technologies.
