We respond to four reviews of The Ordinal Society. We argue that
traditional (and, as our critics point out, much-needed) forms of
resistance and collective action are difficult to mobilize against ordinal
systems, for two reasons. First, people often find these systems
irresistible in use. Second, they operate in a decentralized manner,
bypassing subjectivity (and thus the need for persuasion) to directly
mold individual behavior. We also agree with our critics that the
concentration of power among wealthy “self-organization men” who
can manipulate these systems and mobilize armies of followers may
facilitate highly personal, authoritarian forms of political rule.
