I am Professor of <a href ="http://sociology.duke.edu">Sociology</a> at [Duke University](http://www.duke.edu). Much of my research has been about the social organization of exchange in human blood and organs, cultural goods, software, and ideas. My current work focuses on the moral order of market society, the effect of models and measurement on social classification, and the link between those two topics. I also work on techniques and methods for data visualization, and some problems in social theory.

Most of my <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/publications/">publications and working papers</a> are available on this site, along with information about <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/teaching/">classes I teach</a>, and a lot of <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/">occasional writing</a>. My <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/vita.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a> has more detail, if you need it.
