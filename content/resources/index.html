  <h6>WRITING AND PRESENTING SOCIAL SCIENCE</h6>

<p>This page has links to configuration files, templates, and a few other things that might be of use to people who want to write nicely-formatted social science papers in plain text, with data, figures, and references. I wrote an <a href="blog/archives/2014/01/23/plain-text/">introductory guide to the material here</a> that might be useful for getting oriented.</p>

  <h2><a href="http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/workflow-apps.pdf">Choosing Your Workflow Applications</a> &rarr;</h2>
  <section>
    <p>A short discussion, aimed at graduate students, about why you should think carefully about <a href="http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/workflow-apps.pdf">your workflow applications</a>, i.e., the software tools you use to write papers. It consists of some general principles to bear in mind together with a bunch of specific software recommendations. There is a sample <a href="https://github.com/kjhealy/workflow-paper">github repository</a> that contains the <code>.org</code> source file the PDF is created from.</p>

  <h2><a href="resources/emacs-starter-kit" title="kjhealy/emacs-starter-kit @ GitHub">An Emacs Starter Kit for the Social Sciences</a></h2>
  <section>
    <p>This is a fork of Eric Schulte's <a href="http://github.com/eschulte/emacs-starter-kit/tree">Emacs Starter Kit</a> (itself an offshoot of <a href="http://github.com/eschulte/emacs-starter-kit/tree">Phil Hagelberg's original</a>) with additional tools included for social scientists, mostly related to writing books or papers in LaTeX and analyzing quantitative data using <a href="http://ess.r-project.org/">ESS</a> and <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. The goal is to provide a drop-in configuration for Emacs that makes it easier to use right from the get-go. If you know about <a href="http://git-scm.com/" title="Git - Fast Version Control System">Git</a>, <a href="http://github.com/kjhealy/emacs-starter-kit/tree/master" title="kjhealy's emacs-starter-kit at master &mdash; GitHub">you can clone the repository</a>.</p>

  <h2><a href="https://github.com/kjhealy/pandoc-templates">Pandoc Templates</a> &rarr;</h2>
  <section>
    <p>Some rudimentary Pandoc templates, meant to go in <code>~/.pandoc/templates</code>. Pointed to them directly with the <code>--template</code> or <code>--css</code> switches as appropriate, and use them with what's provided in <a href="http://github.com/kjhealy/latex-custom-kjh"><code>latex-custom-kjh</code></a>. Includes a shell script for setting pandoc up to work with the <a href="http://marked2app.com">Marked</a> app, a handy HTML live previewer for <code>.md</code> files.

  <h2><a href="http://github.com/kjhealy/latex-custom-kjh">LaTeX Templates and Styles</a> &rarr;</h2>
  <section>
    <p>A collection of LaTeX style files, templates, and org-mode documents providing some nice layouts for typesetting articles using pdfLaTeX or XeLaTeX. They make a pipeline that lets you begin with an <code>.org</code> file in Emacs (as set up in the <a href="http://kjhealy.github.com/emacs-starter-kit/">Starter Kit</a>), and go from there to a nice, fully-processed PDF in one step. Or the pieces can be used separately to set up a <code>.tex</code> file with a nice Article layout.</p>

<h2>Present more effectively. For Science.</h2> For all your corporate presentation needs, here is a simple <a href="http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/ApertureScienceKeynote.zip">Aperture Science Keynote Theme</a> (.zip file). The theme requires you have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univers">Univers</a> installed. For maximum effectiveness, the use of this theme is best accompanied by a well-prepared text, a clear speaking voice, and—for fielding questions—a functional Aperture Science military android. To use the theme, unzip it into the <code>~/Library/Application Support/iWork/Keynote/Themes/</code> folder. If you do not have the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univers">Univers</a> typeface installed you will likely get errors about missing resources. See <a href="http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2011/04/19/present-more-effectively-for-science/">this post</a> for some more screenshots.</p>

  <h2><a href="http://kjhealy.github.com/kjh-vita/">So You Like My Vita</a> &rarr;</h2>
  <section>
    <p>Every few months I get an email asking to see the LaTeX markup that I use to generate my <a href="http://kieranhealy.org/vita.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a>. So, <a href="http://kjhealy.github.com/kjh-vita/" title="kjhealy's kjh-vita @ GitHub">here it is</a>. Feel free to adapt it yourself. If you make stylistic modifications, I encourage you to fork the project on GitHub and make them available to others in the same way.</p>

  <h2><a href="https://github.com/kjhealy/socbibs" title="kjhealy's socbibs at  GitHub">BibTeX Files</a> &rarr;</h2>
  <section>
    <p>I maintain a <a href="https://github.com/kjhealy/socbibs" title="kjhealy's socbibs at  GitHub">BibTeX file</a> of (mostly) sociology books and articles containing references cited in my own work. Additions and corrections welcome. I also periodically update a BibTeX database of <a href="http://kjhealy.github.com/bib/" title="kjhealy's philbib @ GitHub">philosophy articles and books</a>, mostly metaphysics and epistemology.</p>
