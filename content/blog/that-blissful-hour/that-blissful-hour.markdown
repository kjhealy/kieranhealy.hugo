[Kevin Drum](http://calpundit.blogspot.com/ "CalPundit") has a post up about the [dangers of nostalgia](http://calpundit.blogspot.com/2003_01_01_calpundit_archive.html#87879199). It reminds me of a poem by Billy Collins, which I happen to have right here in a text file, so I don't have to type it all out:

> NOSTALGIA
>  Billy Collins
>
> Remember the 1340's? We were doing a dance called the Catapult.
>  You always wore brown, the color craze of the decade,
>  and I was draped in one of those capes that were popular,
>  the ones with unicorns and pomegranates in needlework.
>  Everyone would pause for beer and onions in the afternoon,
>  and at night we would play a game called "Find the Cow."
>  Everything was hand-lettered then, not like today.

> Where has the summer of 1572 gone? Brocade and sonnet
>  marathons were the rage. We used to dress up in the flags
>  of rival baronies and conquer one another in cold rooms of stone.
>  Out on the dance floor we were all doing the Struggle
>  while your sister practiced the Daphne all alone in her room.
>  We borrowed the jargon of farriers for our slang.
>  These days language seems transparent a badly broken code.
>
> The 1790's will never come again. Childhood was big.
>  People would take walks to the very tops of hills
>  and write down what they saw in their journals without speaking.
>  Our collars were high and our hats were extremely soft.
>  We would surprise each other with alphabets made of twigs.
>  It was a wonderful time to be alive, or even dead.
>
> I am very fond of the period between 1815 and 1821.
>  Europe trembled while we sat still for our portraits.
>  And I would love to return to 1901 if only for a moment,
>  time enough to wind up a music box and do a few dance steps,
>  or shoot me back to 1922 or 1941, or at least let me
>  recapture the serenity of last month when we picked
>  berries and glided through afternoons in a canoe.
>
> Even this morning would be an improvement over the present.
>  I was in the garden then, surrounded by the hum of bees
>  and the Latin names of flowers, watching the early light
>  flash off the slanted windows of the greenhouse
>  and silver the limbs on the rows of dark hemlocks.
>
> As usual, I was thinking about the moments of the past,
>  letting my memory rush over them like water
>  rushing over the stones on the bottom of a stream.
>  I was even thinking a little about the future, that place
>  where people are doing a dance we cannot imagine,
>  a dance whose name we can only guess.
