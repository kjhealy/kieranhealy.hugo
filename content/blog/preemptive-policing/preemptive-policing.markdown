Via [TalkLeft](http://www.talkleft.com/ "TalkLeft: The Politics of Crime") again (great site, that), the laugh-or-you'd-cry story of Virginia police who, presumably inspired by their Government's foreign policy, were preemptively arresting people for being [drunk in a bar](http://www.talkleft.com/archives/001868.html#001868), on the principle that they might be about to go out and be disorderly, drive home, or gas their own people in an alcohol-fueled rage. (Take your pick.) Former Congreeman Bob Barr said

> This actually is a frightening scenario that one hopes is nipped in the bud.

"But we *were* nipping people 'in the Bud'," a spokesperson for the Virginia police responded.

OK, two lame puns in a row. No more of that today.
