[CalPundit notes:](http://calpundit.blogspot.com/2002_09_22_calpundit_archive.html#82198767)

> There is, in fact, one European country that shares most of America's attitudes and values:
>
> -   Uniquely for western Europe, they value independent military action and have a strong martial culture.
> -   They generally speak only their own language, and when they do speak other languages they do it badly.
> -   They believe in the superiority of their culture and aggressively try to export it abroad though with minimal success these days.
> -   They bargain aggressively and are often seen as obstreperous and arrogant by their fellow Europeans.
> -   They have a permanent seat in the UN Security Council and aren't afraid to use it.
>
> Needless to say, the country is France, the bÃªte-noir of Americans because they're the only European country that acts the way America does.

Oh dear. I don't think my friends [Marion](http://www.princeton.edu/~fourcade) and [Pierre](http://www.princeton.edu/~pog) are going to like that at all.
