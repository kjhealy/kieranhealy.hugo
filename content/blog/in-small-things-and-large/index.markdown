I'm about to go teach my undergrad social theory class. We're reading Adam Smith (at least, I'm reading him) and looking at his argument about the invisible hand of the market . I've already had the class do a couple of practical experiments in distributed co-ordination, which were lots of fun. (At least, they were for me.)

Today we'll look at two of Smith's arguments in the *Wealth of Nations* about why the invisible hand works. The first one anticipates Hayek: "[E]very individual, it is evident, can, in his local situation, judge much better than any statesman or lawgiver can do for him" (*WON* IV.ii). The second one is the idea that "What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom." That one is a mistake, of course, and is the entree to Marx (next week). It also gives me an excuse to put some Thomas Schelling on the syllabus. My class will begin to see *why* it's wrong when I ask them to turn around and shake the hand of the person sitting behind them.

Class prep combined with blogging. Cool. So this *isn't* a complete waste of time after all.
