I just took the [Battleground God](http://www.philosophers.co.uk/games/god.htm) test. My results:

> You took zero direct hits and you bit zero bullets. The average player of this activity to date takes 1.37 hits and bites 1.10 bullets. 96240 people have so far undertaken this activity.

Ha! Who says sociologists can't think straight? Their analysis of my performance says:

> Congratulations!
>
> You have been awarded the TPM medal of honour! This is our highest award for outstanding service on the intellectual battleground.
>
> The fact that you progressed through this activity neither being hit nor biting a bullet suggests that your beliefs about God are internally consistent and very well thought out.

This is my reward for being married to an [analytic metaphysician](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul). Years of conversation with someone able to prove theorems in [quantified modal logic](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/mcchay69/node22.html) teaches you to articulate your position *very carefully* on important questions like "Who's doing the washing up?", "Did you put all the beer in the fridge?", "Can you take out the rubbish?" and "Is that the same plate that was in the sink this morning?" In comparison, a series of trick questions about the existence of God is a cakewalk.
