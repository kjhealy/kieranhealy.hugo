The wacky world of software licensing visits my inbox:

> The newest version of SPSS cannot leave the country according to our current licensing agreement and US Export laws. Additionally, graduate students are not legally allowed to work on laptops (regardless of ownership) that utilizes the university site license. As a result, we are imposing a hiatus on SPSS installations on laptops and on any system that will leave the country until this can be resolved. Anyone who is leaving the country with a UA laptop, please contact us to remove the software before you leave to ensure software licensing and export conditions are met.

They're trying to fix this absurd state of affairs, but the Contracting Office apparently signed off on the original site-license agreement. If you're using SPSS in the first place you need to reconsider your plan for your life, but still.
