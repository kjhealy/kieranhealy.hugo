The NYT has a piece about a new Nickelodeon show called [Wonder Pets](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/28/arts/television/28wond.html?ex=1301202000&en=b9d08665e3eb702f&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss), which follows the adventures of guinea pig, a turtle and a duckling, three schoolroom pets. The show's main innovation is its music. The program is "a series of operettas."

> "We wanted to find a way to have the music drive the show," Mr. Selig said … "we found that kids responded well to having music at the center of everything," with characters singing rather than simply speaking their parts.

> Brown Johnson, Nickelodeon's executive creative director for preschool television, said she believes operetta is an art form particularly suited to children. ... The "Wonder Pets" music does not feature the tinny, saccharine melodies that often infect children's television shows. Rather, each episode uses an original score recorded by a live orchestra overseen by Jeffrey Lesser, the Grammy-winning record producer … Which is not to say that the music is not repetitive. Like many operettas, "The Wonder Pets" is full of hummable recitatives that linger in the minds of both children and adults long after the performance ends.

In light of this, let me just come out and admit that my two-year-old is a slave to Gilbert and Sullivan. She seemed to like choral music whenever it was on the radio, and I remembered that a friend had told me a few years ago that his kids liked it a lot, too. So, like an idiot, I went and bought a CD of Gilbert and Sullivan favorites on the off chance one day. Now it's all she listens to in the car. The other day in the supermarket she solemnly came out with "Stay close to your desks never go to sea … ha ha ha … and you all may be rulers of the [Queen's Navy](http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/pinafore/first_lord.txt)." It's a mixed blessing. On the one hand, my daughter is perfectly happy. On the other hand, I now know all the words to "I Am The Very Model of a Modern Major General." Next stop, *Götterdämmerung*.
