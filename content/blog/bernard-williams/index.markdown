The philosopher [Bernard Williams](http://philosophy.berkeley.edu/williams/) has died. I'll leave it to others better qualified than me to explain his contributions to ethics and other fields, though I did write about one of his [more well-known ideas](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000134.html) a few months ago.
