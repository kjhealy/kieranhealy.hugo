[Alan Schussman takes a first look](http://www.schussman.com/article/1155/katrina-by-the-numbers) at the social ecology of the flooded areas of New Orleans:

> The flood area has a population of about 380,000. Here's how it compares to national numbers [from the 2000 census]:
>
>   ------------ ------------------ --------- ----------- ------------- ------------------ -----------------
>                median HH income   % black   % poverty   % owns home   % private trans.   % public trans.
>   US           $ 41,994           12.1      12.3        66.2          87.9               4.7
>   Flood area   $ 29,854           66.8      26.9        50.6          79.0               13.0

> These real numbers should be part of the discussion of why so many people didn't get out of town. Jack Shafer [gives it some thought](http://www.slate.com/id/2124688/nav/tap2/), but it's also informative to compare these numbers with national rates: In the flooded area of the city, poverty is more than twice as high as the national rate; median income is twelve thousand dollars lower; reliance on public transportation is nearly three times as high. Lower rates of owner-occupation mean a greater lack of insurance coverage â€¦
