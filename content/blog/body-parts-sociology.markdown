I have left the bitter [Sonoran desert](http://www.desertusa.com/du_sonoran.html) behind and am in [balmy Chicago](http://www.steve-carol.com/Winter%20in%20Chicago%201.jpg) for a [conference about body parts](http://www.law.depaul.edu/institutes_centers/health/pdf/body_parts.pdf). Packing my suitcase, I realized that I'm going to have some trouble keeping my own body parts at a reasonable temperature: where are all those Winter clothes I used to own? Didn't I live in New Jersey and Connecticut for years? So I just brought everything I had.

The conference should be interesting. Mainly lawyers and bioethics people, along with some economists. I am the token sociologist. I'll be talking about some work I'm doing on organ procurement rates in seventeen OECD countries, so obviously I am on the panel titled "The Battle Between Bioethics and Religion." As it happens, my friend [John Evans](http://sociology.ucsd.edu/faculty/EvansJ.htm) wrote [the book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226222624/kieranhealysw-20/ref=nosim/) on the battle between bioethics and religion. The final score was Bioethics 3, Religion 1.
