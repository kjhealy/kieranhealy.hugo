Via [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/04/steorns-orbo-free-energy-machine-demonstrated-tomorrow/) comes news that [Steorn](http://www.steorn.com/) are back with an allegedly working demonstration of their magnetic "free energy" (i.e., perpetual motion) machine, the [Orbo](http://www.steorn.com/orbo/). You may remember them from [last year](http://crookedtimber.org/2006/08/22/free-lunch-and-irish-breakfast/). As before, the reading on the kookometer is over in the red, as the device is being pitched directly to the media, the demo is taking place as a show at an [art museum](http://www.kinetica-museum.org/new_site/), and some convoluted jury system "challenge" is in place to validate it. The smart money, I believe, is of the view that Steorn—if they're not just charlatans—have honestly reinvented some version of the [magnetic motor](http://www.google.com/search?q=magnet+motor), a mainstay of perpetual motion cranks.
