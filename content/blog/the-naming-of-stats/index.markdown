The Naming of Stats is a difficult matter,<br>
     It isn’t just one of your holiday games;<br>
You may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter<br>
When I tell you, a stat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.<br>
First of all are the names where usage is informal,<br>
     Such as Median, Estimate, Average, or Range,<br> 
Such as Variance, Quartile, or else Standard Normal<br> 
     All of them sensible everyday names.<br>
There are fancier names that may be better-tasting,<br>
     Some for the frequentists, some for the Bayes:<br>
Such as Skew, or Kurtosis, Metropolis–Hastings—<br>
     But all of them sensible everyday names.<br>
But I tell you, a stat needs a name that’s obscurer,<br>
     A name that’s misleading, and hard to construe,<br>
Else how can it keep on confusing the reader,<br>
     Or frustrate professors, or pass peer review?<br>	 
Of names of this kind, there are many examples,<br>
     Like Hierarchical, Robust, or Omega-hat,<br>
Such as Marginal, Confidence, or just Weighted Sample,<br>
     Names that always belong to more than one stat.<br>
But above and beyond there’s still one name left over,<br>
     And that is the name that you never will guess;<br>
The thing that no human research can discover—<br>
     But THE STAT MIGHT JUST KNOW, and be made to confess.<br>
When you notice a stat getting quite widely cited,<br>
     The reason, I tell you, is always because:<br>
Its user’s engaged, or enraged, or excited<br>
     At the prospect of pinning the root of all laws:<br>
          That inviolable, friable<br>
          Unidentifiable<br>
Deep and inscrutable singular Cause.<br>
