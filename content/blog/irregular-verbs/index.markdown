[Commenting](http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/000740.html) on the whole [Erik Rasmusen](http://php.indiana.edu/~erasmuse/weblog1.htm#september2a) thing at Indiana, Dan Drezner and the voice in his head write:

> ... the cure for promulgated ideas that are believed to be offensive or wrong is more speech, not less. ... What need there is for a review beyond that is truly beyond me. ... [*Wait, wait, you forgot the ritual denunciation of Rasmusen's views on homosexuality.â€”ed.* That's completely irrelevant to this question. ... however, it's worth highlighting a fact that Louis Menand pointed out in *The Metaphysical Club*:
>

Looks like one of those [irregular verbs](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-nireland/A744257) that used to come up so often on [Yes, Minister](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/000502.html). In this case we get:

> [I](http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/000740.html) make provocative analogies. 
>  [You](http://www.antipixel.com/blog/archives/2002/12/18/jurisdiction_a_shot_across_the_bow.html) draw inappropriate comparisons. 
>  [He](http://www.instapundit.com/archives/005027.php) is an idiotarian fixated on moral equivalence.
