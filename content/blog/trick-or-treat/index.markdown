Or, "Anything for Halloween?" as we used to chant at doorways when we went around in the Days Before Television. Other differences between Halloween in Ireland then and the U.S. now include the absence of pumpkins and the stricter dress codeâ€”we had to dress up as *something* frightening, whereas in the U.S. it's more like a fancy dress party. A final difference: the apartment across the way from us has a pumpkin carved with "W '04". I get the sense that there's a bit of strife between the college girls who share the apartment, as one of them keeps turning the pumpkin around so that the uncarved side faces outward. If the carver comes trick-or-treating I'll be sure to ask why she expects a handout from me. Let the market provide you with candy, I say.
