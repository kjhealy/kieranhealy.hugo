Because [Eric Rauchway](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/)'s book on [The Great Depression and New Deal](http://www.amazon.com/Great-Depression-New-Deal-Introductions/dp/0195326342/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1211494718&sr=1-1) makes inordinately heavy demands on the reader, is filled with hard-to-remember facts, and spends too much of its absurd length wistfully discussing fashions in men's suits and hats of the period, I have been looking for a brief video to show in its place to undergrads in my social theory class. It's good to finally have found it.
