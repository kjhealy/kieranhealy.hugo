I just read this on [Slate's](http://www.slate.com) 'Breakfast Table':
 *
 Returning to Sutton's after a couple of weeks away in Washington, I settle into a vacant counter seat and inquire what people have been talking about in my absence. "Top three" I'm told, are "the Catholic Church, the Catholic Church, and the Catholic Church." From the end of the counter Mike Walker cheerfully scorns the bishops' newly minted sex policy as "**three tykes and you're out**."*

Who says there's no wit in America?
