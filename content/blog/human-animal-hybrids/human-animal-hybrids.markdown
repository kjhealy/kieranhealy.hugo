Catching up with the talk about the State of the Union address, I noticed the President's complaints about "human-animal hybrids" have [attracted](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_02/008128.php) [some](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/02/president_panders_to_antimanim.php) [commentary](http://atrios.blogspot.com/2006_01_29_atrios_archive.html#113880272560367200). P.Z. Myers [pointed out](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/02/president_panders_to_antimanim.php) that scientists are working toward producing a model system for Down Syndrome (i.e. a genetically-engineered mouse with human genes), and that this might further understanding of the condition in peopleâ€”a worthwhile goal. But we should bear in mind that there's *already* a real, live human-animal hybrid creature in widespread use today. Its job is to slave away producing a substance that millions of people use routinely. That substance is [insulin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin). Virtually the entire commercial supply these days is produced by [genetically modified e-coli bacteria that contain human DNA](http://www.littletree.com.au/dna.htm), live in a fungal substrate and secrete human insulin. I take it that the President isn't planning to put every Type I Diabetic in America into hypoglycemic shock. I don't think it would be a popular policy plank.
