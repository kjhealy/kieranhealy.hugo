[Ted](http://instapundit.com/archives/018438.php) beat me to this, mostly. But I wanted to say this: I'm sure if we trawl through our 1990s archives we'll find that the [high-minded](http://instapundit.com/archives/018438.php) and their lofty correspondents

> Reader Keith Rempel gets at the heart of what's wrong here, and articulates what I couldn't: "Kerry was using Cheney's daughter to harm her father. ... ANOTHER UPDATE: "More thoughts [here](http://thoughtsonline.blogspot.com/2004/10/james-taranto-and-others-may-be-right.html): 'thou shall NOT speak of another's kid in any way that could POSSIBLY be construed as negative' ... MORE: ... James Somers emails: "Kerry crassly exploited Cheney's daughter for use against Bush and thus, by extension, Cheney. Perhaps you have to be a parent to understand what that means."

were *right out there on the front lines* defending Chelsea Clinton from anything that might have been [construed](http://blog.radioleft.com/blog/_archives/2004/9/4/135257.html) as [insulting](http://www.nationalreview.com/derbyshire/derbyshire021501.shtml) at the time. (We can leave aside—as perhaps too complex to grasp—the point that it is not actually an insult to mention that someone who has worked in various professional and political contexts doing outreach work with the gay community is, in fact, gay.) I'm waiting to see if the parallel to Chelsea strikes any of the [people](http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/04_10_10_corner-archive.asp#042735) over at [The Corner](http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner) who are [waving](http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/04_10_10_corner-archive.asp#042700) the [flag](http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/04_10_10_corner-archive.asp#042692) of ['common decency'](http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/04_10_10_corner-archive.asp#042748) in defence of Mary Cheney at the moment. But, of course, I forget: when *they're* insulted it's an offense to common decency and [civility](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/001227.html), but when *we're* insulted it's just more political correctness and evidence that the left is [too sensitive](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000214.html) and has no sense of humor.
