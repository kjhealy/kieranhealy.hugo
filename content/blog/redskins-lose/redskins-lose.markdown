[In every Presidential election-year since 1936](http://www.snopes.com/sports/football/election.asp), if the Washington Redskins lost their last game before the election, the [incumbent lost as well](http://www.sacbee.com/24hour/weird/story/1774448p-9625249c.html). In [today's game](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=241031028), the Packers beat Washington **28 â€“ 14**. A late rally by the Redskins in the 4th Quarter couldn't save them. This is the strongest spurious evidence yet that Kerry's going to win on Tuesday.
