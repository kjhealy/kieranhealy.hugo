In a distant [possible world](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0631224262), I am [writing a book](http://eleganthack.com/blog/) about [information architecture, usability and interaction design](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712506/eleganthack) rather than simply planning to buy one. The closest I get to this stuff—- and it's plenty close, often enough—- is when I get to think about how best to convey [my research data [pdf]](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/files/opo-procmap.pdf). Then I get to use [statistical software](http://www.r-project.org/) that applies the [right principles](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?isbn=0963488414) and the [best practices](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0961392142).
