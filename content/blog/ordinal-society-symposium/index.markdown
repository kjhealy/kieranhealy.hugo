The _Socio-Economic Review_ has published a [book symposium](https://academic.oup.com/ser/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/ser/mwaf057/8317764) on [_The Ordinal Society_](https://theordinalsociety.com) with contributions from Nitsan Chorev, J.P. Pardo-Guerra, and Greta Krippner, followed by a reply from Marion and myself. (Here's a [PDF of the exchange](https://kieranhealy/org/files/papers/tos-keeping-score.pdf).) There's also a symposium at the _Journal of Cultural Economy_ with contributions from [Hatim A. Rahman](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2025.2525986), [Julien Migozzi](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2025.2523771), and [Michelle Jackson](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2025.2531852), again with a [reply from us](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2025.2523767). Finally there's also a new review from [Michael Sauder in _ASQ_](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00018392251394664) ([PDF](sauder-ordinal-society.pdf)), which follows on reviews from [Barbara Kiviat in _Social Forces_](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/103/4/e18/7964715) ([PDF](kiviat-ordinal-society.pdf)), and Laura Nelson in [_Acta Sociologica_](https://www.lauraknelson.com/publication/book-review-ordinal-society/ordinal-society-review.pdf).

As we say more than once in our replies, it's very gratifying to have your peers in the field take the time to read your work.
