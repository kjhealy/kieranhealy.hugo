[Matthew Yglesias](http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/000109.html#000109 "Matthew Yglesias") notices a FOX news item on the poor domestic economy titled "The Price of Freedom". He asks:

> Does Fox honestly want us to believe that the economy's poor performance under the Bush administration is some kind of price that we must pay in order to remain free?

Well, yes. I'd say that's exactly what they want their viewers to thinkâ€”the price we must pay for the Iraqis to remain free, anyway.

I want regular market reports on the price of freedom and related investments. "Freedom (stock symbol: GOP) fell three points today in heavy trading", "Freedom futures are being sold off in large numbers after Attorney General Ashcroft's latest statement", "This quarter's Peace Dividend will be paid out of profits from the sale of Bechtel stock", etc.
