[A subsidiary of Halliburton](http://money.cnn.com/2003/03/25/news/companies/war_contracts/index.htm "Iraq rebuilding contracts awarded - Mar. 25, 2003") has won one of the first contracts to be awarded by the Government for rebuilding work in Iraq.

**Update**: For dessert, cynics may note that it was a [no-bid contract](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/afp/20030325/wl_mideast_afp/iraq_postwar_us_oil&e=5).

**Update 2**: Actually, these appear to be two different contracts, both to Halliburton subsidiaries, one bid and one no-bid.
