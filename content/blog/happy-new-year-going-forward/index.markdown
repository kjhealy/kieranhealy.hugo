[**A seasonal message from Jamie Targett, our Director of Corporate Affairs**](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=414711&c=1)

> Soon it will be time to remove all traces of the officially authorised low-key festive accessories that have decorated our offices during the festive season. Time also to turn our faces towards the future that is to come. Time to evaluate our personal strategic objectives and our intended goal outcomes. Time to contemplate our game plan, examine core competencies, reinforce best practices, break out of silos, exert maximum leverage, evolve new synergies and maximise our skill sets.
>
> A very happy management-oriented New Year to you all.
