David Post [complains](http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2004_10_21.shtml#1098372619) that John Kerry was not at the game to see the Red Sox beat the Yankees:

> AND WHERE WAS JOHN? ... I'm surprised that there hasn't been much talk about why we didn't see Kerry at any of the games. He's the junior senator from Massachusetts; he's got a bona fide reason to snap his fingers, get the front row seats, put on his sox cap and jacket, and root like an ordinary human being. What, he doesn't want the national TV exposure?? Was he worried about alienating Yankee fans? I guess one shouldn't make too much of what is "just a ballgame," but really: to his constituents, this is the most important thing going on at the moment; he's lived and worked in Massachusetts all his life; is he the only person in that category who wouldn't take free tickets to see these games? I honestly don't get it, and it does make me wonder about the guy.

Note the pincer movement here. On the one hand, Kerry should have been at the game because that's what "an ordinary human being" would do. On the other hand, Kerry is not a regular guy, because he's a senator, is running for President, and he could have snapped his fingers to get front row seats. So, either he snaps his fingers or he doesn't. He chose not to, for whatever reason, and so leaves himself open on the flank David attacks: "who wouldn't take free tickets… does make me wonder about the guy" and so on. But say Kerry *had* snapped his fingers and gotten front row seats, his face on the Jumbotron and the inevitable TV News coverage. What then? It's obvious. He'd have opened himself up to whinging on just the *opposite* grounds, viz, "Isn't it typical of an elitist Senator who hasn't been to a game all season to just snap his fingers, get front row seats, and try to use the Red Sox's historic victory as a campaign rally? A classier guy—any ordinary human being, really—would have stayed away and let the fact that the Sox beat the curse have the limelight." Heads I win, Tails you lose.
