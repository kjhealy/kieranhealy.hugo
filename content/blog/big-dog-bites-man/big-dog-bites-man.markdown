You should watch David Dimbleby's [interview with Bill Clinton](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsa/n5ctrl/progs/panorama/latest.ram). After a bunch of Monica questions, Clinton ticks Dimbleby off for being just like every other journalist who were—how to put it?—so obsessed with Lewinsky's blowjobs that they didn't realize how they were helping Ken Starr to screw people. (Jump to 28:25 or so in the interview to see this). Dimbo looks a bit shocked:

> **Clinton**: Let me just say this. One of the reasons he [Kenneth Starr] got away with it is because people like you only ask me the questions. You gave him a complete free ride. Any abuse they wanted to do. They indicted all these little people from Arkansas, what did you care about them, they're not famous, who cares that their life was trampled. Who cares that their children are humiliated … Nobody in your line of work cared a rip about that at the time. Why, because he was helping their story… Now that doesn't justify any mistake I made. But look how much time you spent asking me these questions, in this time you've had. That's because it's what you care about, because that's what you think helps you and helps this interview… And that's why people like you always help the far-right, because you like to hurt people, and you like to talk about how bad people are and all their personal failings.

> **Dimbleby**: I don't—
>  **Clinton**: Look, you made a decision to allocate your time in a certain way, you should take responsibility for that, you should say 'Yes, I care much more about this than whether the Bosnian people were saved, and whether he brought a million home from Kosovo … [or] than whether we moved a hundred times as many people out of poverty as Reagan and Bush'.

The [BBC's own write-up](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3829799.stm) write up of the interview quotes some of the best bits, but they try rather too hard to frame it as Bill Goes Ballistic:

> Wagging his finger and getting visibly agitated, Mr Clinton expressed anger at the media's behaviour. ... But despite the shaky start, Mr Clinton quickly recovered his composure and was questioned for a further 30 minutes by Mr Dimbleby.

[Watch the interview for yourself](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsa/n5ctrl/progs/panorama/latest.ram) (starts about 12:00 in) and decide whether Clinton loses his composure, looks shaky or is noticeably agitated. As far as I can see, Clinton hardly raises his voice and does little more than sit up in his chair. It's also noticeable that he hardly drops a syllable, hems, haws, or mangles a word as he speaks. Say what you like about the guy and his legacy, he knows how to fight his corner. I don't see the current incumbent being subjected to that kind of persistent questioning in six or seven years—or even right now, come to think of it.
