Via [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) comes news that the already somewhat odd augmenting of U.S. currency with larger typefaces and random bits of color has taken a horrible turn. Behold the new five dollar bill.

The new additions to this bill, apparently intended to increase legibility and accessibility, were made by my daughter, who is four. Or possibly by [Harold and His Purple Crayon](http://books.google.com/books?id=be5xZ1X-ZRAC&dq=harold+and+the+purple+crayon&pg=PP1&ots=f3RaMEk27z&sig=qHtn6KJm193t29ca2liQXbGPQb0&hl=en&prev=http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=harold+and+the+purple+crayon&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sa=X&oi=print&ct=title&cad=one-book-with-thumbnail). Actually, as the folks at [Hoefler & Frere-Jones](http://www.typography.com/ask/showBlog.php?blogID=93) point out, this monstrosity is in fact "the work of a 147-year-old government agency called the United States Bureau of Engraving and Printing. It employs 2,500 people, and has an annual budget of $525,000,000."

Meanwhile in Britain, the design for their [new line of coins](http://www.royalmint.com/newdesigns/designsRevealed.aspx%20) was selected after an open competition and is the work of a 26 year-old designer who hadn't tried his hand at coin design before.
