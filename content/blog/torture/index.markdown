Two good posts on the continuing slide towards routinized and euphemized torture by the U.S., one at [Body and Soul](http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2005/03/the_beast_in_us.html) and one at [Respectful of Otters](http://respectfulofotters.blogspot.com/2005_03_01_respectfulofotters_archive.html#111068506853331238). Jim Henley [notes](http://highclearing.com/index.php/archives/2005/03/11/4026) a couple of recent domestic crime cases where the obvious suspects turned out not to have done it, asking "Couldn√¢t we have tortured the "right" people into confessing to both these crimes?" (That [real-estate arson](http://www.jrrobertssecurity.com/security-news/security-crime-news0013.htm) last year in Maryland was in that category, too.) Meanwhile, [Juan Non-Volokh](http://www.volokh.com/archives/archive_2005_03_06-2005_03_12.shtml#1110426704) tries to talk himself into it through the latest version of the [ticking bomb](http://crookedtimber.org/2004/06/18/by-the-power-of-stipulation-i-have-the-power) objection.
