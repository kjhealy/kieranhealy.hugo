Bloggers with more patience than me have been dealing with the tragic story of Terri Schiavo. [Lindsay Beyerstein](http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2005/03/the_left_and_te.html) has been [especially good](http://www.alternet.org/story/21572). It's clear that the Republican position on Schiavo is sheer grandstanding and hypocritical to boot. There's plenty of evidence for this, what with President Bush's signature on the [Texas Futile Care Law](http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/schiavo_/2005/03/schiavo_futile_care_and_money.php) and Bill Frist's [statements about Christopher Reeve](http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_03_20_atrios_archive.html#111169758487216228) and his support for [harvesting organs from anencephalic children](http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_03_20_atrios_archive.html#111160342761631336). And never mind the broader policy context where the fiscal means whereby people might support patients in persistent vegetative states—via Medicare and bankruptcy protection—are being hacked away. Now, via [DC Media Girl](http://dcmediagirl.com/index.php?entry=entry20050324-204119), we have the icing on the cake. Some [Fox News Pundit](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,151442,00.html) is thinking that Jeb Bush should just authorize a SWAT team to storm the hospice and get Terri Schiavo out:

> Just to burnish my reputation as a bomb thrower, I think Jeb Bush should give serious thought to storming the Bastille. By that I mean he should think about telling his cops to go over to Terri Schiavo's (search) hospice, go inside, put her on a gurney and load her into an ambulance. They could take her to a hospital, revive her, and reattach her feeding tube. ... So Jeb, call out the troops, storm the Bastille and tell 'em I sent you.
