Our transition to [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) radically increased our database usage. Then we got a bit of an uptick in traffic on top of that and our [host provider](http://www.dreamhost.com) pulled the plug on us because we were gobbling up a lot of resources that needed to be shared. I have to say I think they were a bit peremptory about it. But in any event it seems we're going to have to get a dedicated server now. Bit more pricey. Hopefully we'll turn this around quickly and be back online soon.
