Recently, Chris Bertram [evaluated](http://junius.blogspot.com/2003_01_19_junius_archive.html#90219075 "Junius") the case for war and found it wanting. He noted that there were no easy answers, but "The burden of justification, though, lies with those who would make war" and that [the case as made](http://junius.blogspot.com/2003_01_19_junius_archive.html#90208739) was very weak. How weak? Via [Drapetomaniac](http://www.backspace.com/common/) comes [a link to a site](http://www.whodies.com/index.html) that brings together inormation about likely costs of a war and the reliability of the claims made in favor of it.
