I've just discovered that complete versions of both [Yes, Minister](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008DP4B/kieranhealysw-20/ref=nosim/) and [Yes, Prime Minister](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009XN37/kieranhealysw-20/ref=nosim/) are available on DVD. On to the wish list they go. And I recommend you follow those links and buy them yourself, too.

Question for discussion: Compare and contrast the political culture that gave us this series to the one that produced [The West Wing](http://www.nbc.com/The_West_Wing/).

The [Yes Minister website](http://www.yes-minister.com) throws up a classic dialog from the show on the value of opinion polls. Here it is:

> Sir Humphrey: "You know what happens: nice young lady comes up to you. Obviously you want to create a good impression, you don't want to look a fool, do you? So she starts asking you some questions: Mr. Woolley, are you worried about the number of young people without jobs?"
>  Bernard Woolley: "Yes"
>  Sir Humphrey: "Are you worried about the rise in crime among teenagers?"
>  Bernard Woolley: "Yes"
>  Sir Humphrey: "Do you think there is a lack of discipline in our Comprehensive schools?"
>  Bernard Woolley: "Yes"
>  Sir Humphrey: "Do you think young people welcome some authority and leadership in their lives?"
>  Bernard Woolley: "Yes"
>  Sir Humphrey: "Do you think they respond to a challenge?"
>  Bernard Woolley: "Yes"
>  Sir Humphrey: "Would you be in favour of reintroducing National Service?"
>  Bernard Woolley: "Oh…well, I suppose I might be."
>  Sir Humphrey: "Yes or no?"
>  Bernard Woolley: "Yes"
>  Sir Humphrey: "Of course you would, Bernard. After all you told you can't say no to that. So they don't mention the first five questions and they publish the last one."
>  Bernard Woolley: "Is that really what they do?"
>  Sir Humphrey: "Well, not the reputable ones no, but there aren't many of those. So alternatively the young lady can get the opposite result."
>  Bernard Woolley: "How?"
>  Sir Humphrey: "Mr. Woolley, are you worried about the danger of war?"
>  Bernard Woolley: "Yes"
>  Sir Humphrey: "Are you worried about the growth of armaments?"
>  Bernard Woolley: "Yes"
>  Sir Humphrey: "Do you think there is a danger in giving young people guns and teaching them how to kill?"
>  Bernard Woolley: "Yes"
>  Sir Humphrey: "Do you think it is wrong to force people to take up arms against their will?"
>  Bernard Woolley: "Yes"
>  Sir Humphrey: "Would you oppose the reintroduction of National Service?"
>  Bernard Woolley: "Yes!"
>  Sir Humphrey: "There you are, you see Bernard. The perfect balanced sample."
