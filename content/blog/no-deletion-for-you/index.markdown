Further administrative processing has resulted in your previous identification being reidentified:

> You have been identified as having received an erroneous account deletion notification message. The problem that caused you to receive that message has been resolved and your account has been removed from the list of accounts that are scheduled to be deleted on 4/07/2008. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.
