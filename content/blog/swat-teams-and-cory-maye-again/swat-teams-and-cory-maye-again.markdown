The BBC are running a story about [SWAT raids](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4803570.stm). The hook is the case of Dr Salvatore Culosoi, a Virginia doctor who was under investigation for illegal gambling. Culosi was unarmed, had no history of violent behavior, and threatened no-one during the raid. He was shot dead by a police officer. A striking statistic from the article is that the number of SWAT raids per year has increased from 3,000 in the 1980s to "at least 40,000 per year" now. Seems like a straightforward [garbage-can](http://faculty.washington.edu/krumme/gloss/g.html) process at the organizational level, or a [neoinstitutionalist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_institutionalism) story at the field level: SWAT teams are effective in certain situations. Initially, it's cutting-edge departments who have them. They also get a lot of press. The gear [makes a nice recruiting tool](http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/s.w.a.t./), too. Pretty soon, you need one if you want to be seen as a respectable police department. Once you have one, it's a solution sitting around waiting for problems to apply itself to. Seeing as your podunk town is unlikely to have a hostage crisis, the bar for its application gets lowered way, way down. Voila, the police force is now militarized.

The story led me back to [Radley Balko's](http://www.theagitator.com/) outstanding coverage of the [Cory Maye case](http://www.theagitator.com/archives/cat_cory_maye.php), which I wrote about [late last year](http://crookedtimber.org/2005/12/12/knock-knock-bang-bang/). It's to Balko's great credit that he's been following up on this miscarriage of justice. He's working on a magazine article about the case, which I sincerely hope appears where people will see it. Right now the Maye case shows that a lot of blogger agitation (about a nonpartisan issue, no less) can just sink without a trace unless it gets picked up by the media.
