Via [Chris Uggen](http://chrisuggen.blogspot.com/2006/05/us-incarceration-at-midyear-2005.html), some new [Bureau of Justice Statistics](http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/press/pjim05pr.htm) for incarceration in the United States as of mid-2005. Imprisonment rose by 1.6 percent on the pervious year, and jail populations rose by 4.7 percent, for a total of just over 2.1 million people behind bars. The total population in prison has gone up by almost 600,000 since 1995.

Women make up 12.7 percent of jail inmates. Nearly 6 in 10 offenders in local jails are racial or ethnic minorities. In mid-2005, the BJS reports that "nearly 4.7 percent of black males were in prison or jail, compared to 1.9 percent of Hispanic males, and 0.7 percent of white males. Among males in their late 20s, nearly 12 percent of black males, compared to 3.9 percent of Hispanic males and 1.7 percent of white males, were incarcerated." State by state, "Louisiana and Georgia led the nation in percentage of their state residents incarcerated (with more than 1 percent of their state residents in prison or jail at midyear 2005). Maine and Minnesota had the lowest rates of incarceration (with 0.3 percent or less of their state residents incarcerated)."

(You can get this figure [as a PDF file](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/incarceration-rates.pdf) if you like.)

Comparative context is provided by Roy Walmsley's [World Prison Population List](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/rel/icps/world-prison-population-list-2005.pdf). The U.S. has an overall incarceration rate of 738 per 100,000 people, the highest in the world. Belarus, Russia and Bermuda (!) come next, distantly trailing with rates in the 530s. Fifty eight percent of countries have incarceration rates below 150 per 100,000. There is a lot of heterogeneity within continents. I left China out of the figure aboveâ€”its incarceration rate is 118, but this only includes 1.55 million sentenced prisoners, not trial detainees or those in "administrative detention."
