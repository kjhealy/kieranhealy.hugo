I just found out (about half an hour ago) that I [won an award](http://www.asanet.org/media/2002awards.html). (Scroll down after you click.) I'm on holidays in Washington state at the moment, so I guess I've been out of touch. Laurie's conference at Western Washington University started this morning, so I drove down to Seattle to visit my friend Becky. When I arrived she said "Congratulations on the award." I said "What award?"

Wow. I need to have a beer or something.
