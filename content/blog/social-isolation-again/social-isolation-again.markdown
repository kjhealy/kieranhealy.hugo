Miller McPherson, Lynn Smith-Lovin and Matt Brashears' [ASR Paper](http://www.asanet.org/galleries/default-file/June06ASRFeature.pdf) on changes in core discussion networks has been getting a lot of play in the blogs and media. As is often the case with research like this, the commentary doesn't really do justice to the paper. The summaries tend to be superficial and a lot of the commentary raises questions that the paper addresses, or proposes explanations it controls for. But [I liked this piece](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/28/opinion/meyer/main1762234.shtml) from CBS's Dick Meyer. He kicks around various ideas about the significance of the findings and their explanation in the generalizing mode you'd expect an Op-Ed commentator to adopt, but it's also clear that he read and understood the paper. It's probably the best journalistic discussion of the issue I've seen so far.
