A prompt from [Dan Hirschman](http://asociologist.wordpress.com/) made me dig up this [review essay on Donald MacKenzie's *An Engine, Not a Camera*](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/scottishverdict.pdf). A shorter version appeared ages ago on OrgTheory, and this version never quite got finished, but some people have found the discussion useful so [here it is](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/scottishverdict.pdf) as a PDF.
