I came across [The Cambridge Companion to Keynes](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1163114559/ref=nosim/kieranhealysw-20) in the bookshop yesterday and went to add it to my Amazon wishlist this morning. When I looked it up in the catalog I saw that it had a rating of only 2 stars and my first thought was: I bet *that* guy is responsible! And I was right. A while ago I was poking around in the literature on Keynes and Post-Keynesianism and anytime I checked a book on Amazon there would be a review from [Michael E. Brady](http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1UI9T8WKJPZN5/ref=cm_cr_auth/002-9644667-3828001). Typically, it would be a long, desnely-written single paragraph of criticism, complete with page references to the literature and especially to Keynes's works.

In fairness, his [complete list of Amazon reviews](http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UI9T8WKJPZN5/002-9644667-3828001?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3) (333 of them at current count) shows he is perfectly capable of writing a generous review. But he does have a couple of bees in his bonnet. [He](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product//B0006C2TOW/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/002-9644667-3828001) [doesn't](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product//1858986532/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/002-9644667-3828001) [like](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product//0802022960/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/002-9644667-3828001) people who Get Keynes' Macroeconomics Wrong at all. Even beyond the macro stuff, however, he gets very annoyed at critics of Keynes' [Treatise on Probability](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product//1596055308/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/002-9644667-3828001), whom he sees as slavishly following the [allegedly mistaken](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product//0199279551/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/002-9644667-3828001) (and ad hominem) views of Frank Ramsey. In a way, Brady's own reviews on this topic can be read as an effort to undo the effects of what [he clearly thinks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product//9812384081/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/002-9644667-3828001) of as the worst book reviews of all time, namely Ramsey's 1922 and 1926 comments on Keynes' *Treatise*, whose malign effects have propagated down through the literature. A true believer. Here is [his own book](http://www.amazon.com/Essays-Keynes-Michael-Emmett-Brady/dp/141344959X) on Keynes.
