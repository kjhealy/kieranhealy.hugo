Via [Teresa](http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/010395.html#010395). I have to say that I was skeptical for the first fifty seconds or so, what with the new-agey soundtrack and the apparently solo globetrotting, but what comes after is just absurdly sweet in a nerd-brings-the-world-together sort of a way. Enjoy.
