Loyal readers (a big shout-out to my cat) ask, What have I been doing for the last two days? Have I been writing papers? Gathering data? Teaching classes? Somewhat. But mainly, I have been getting [Adobe Caslon](http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_180.jhtml) to install properly under [TeX](http://www.tug.org/) on Linux, so that I can use a beautiful typeface (with [old-style figures](http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/CASF/F_CASF-10105000.jhtml)) for my notional book draft. This was made more difficult by the fact that I bought the [cheap package](http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_913.jhtml) rather than the base font and expert set.

Now you may think that the important thing about a book is the content, and that's what I should be worrying about. But the sad fact is that I'm such a font junkie that seeing even a rough draft properly typeset (with [LaTeX](http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_913.jhtml)) with a professional font makes me much, much more likely to continue writing it. At least I'm not alone in my addiction. And all you Microsoft Word people out there have [no idea](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html) what you're missing.
