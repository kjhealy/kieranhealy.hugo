Via [Ben Hyde](http://enthusiasm.cozy.org/) (whom I met last week at the [Open Source conference](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000466.html#000466)) comes this [bit of AI](http://y.20q.net:8095/btest "20Q"). If you're tired of those "Which *x* are you?" quizzes, try this one. It beat me the first three times I played it, until I started thinking of much harder words. Trying to figure out what *counts* as a hard word is interesting in itself.
