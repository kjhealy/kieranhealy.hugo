Say what you like about the free-marketeers, they certainly know how to ignore market forces, eschew profit and embrace subsidization when it suits them. I just got the 2006 [Liberty Fund](http://www.libertyfund.org/) catalog in the post, and as usual I am having a hard time not buying a lot of their absurdly under-priced offerings. You can get the [complete Sraffa/Dobb edition of Ricardo](http://www.libertyfund.org/details.asp?displayID=1876) (eleven volumes!) for about a hundred bucks, or $12 for individual volumes. (The true measure of value is in there *somewhere*.) For similar prices, there's more [Gordon Tullock](http://www.libertyfund.org/details.asp?displayID=1877) or [James Buchanan](http://www.libertyfund.org/details.asp?displayID=1598) than any sane person would ever want to read. You can also get the whole [Glasgow Edition of Smith](http://www.libertyfund.org/details.asp?displayID=1654) for seventy five dollars. Or sixteen hundred pages of [Armen Alchian](http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/General/ALCHIAN.HTM) for fifteen dollars. They're also strong on Enlightenment types, with [Hume's History of England](http://www.libertyfund.org/details.asp?displayID=1659) on the cheap, and you can find any amount of reactionary commentary on the French Revolution, too.

On the other hand, you can get a lot of this stuff (the Ricardo, for instance) [for free and in PDF format](http://oll.libertyfund.org/Home3/AuthorsAll.php) at their Online Library of Liberty.
