I've [written before](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/000432.html) about the way debates about work-family conflict are framed. In general, men with children are not thought to face work/family choices. [Alternatives](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195147146/kieranhealysw-20/ref=nosim/) to this way of thinking about it—[analyzing](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565847474/kieranhealysw-20/ref=nosim/) the institutions that structure people's choices, for example—are often dismissed as utopian flim-flam. It's a good example of how social facts are mistaken for natural facts. Quite sensible people—who know that it's silly to argue that cloning, contraceptives and representative government are wrong because they are "unnatural," for instance—can often be found insisting that the Pleistocene Savannah has set implacable constraints on the institutional design of work/family policies in postindustrial democracies. This is not in itself a clearly wrong claim, but, oddly, the particular constraints closely approximate the gender division of labor not of the Pleistocene Savannah but of portions of the U.S. middle class between 1945 and 1960.

I bring this up because I read an [interesting report](http://www.aaup.org/publications/Academe/02nd/02ndmas.htm) on the impact of children on men's and women's careers in academia. There are several ways to put the findings, but here's one:

> Twelve to fourteen years out from the Ph.D., **62 percent of tenured women in the humanities and social sciences and 50 percent of those in the sciences do not have children in the household**. By contrast, only 39 percent of tenured men in social sciences and humanities and 30 percent of those in the sciences do not have children in the household …
