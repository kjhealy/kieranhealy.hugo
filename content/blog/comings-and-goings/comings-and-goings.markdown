So I'm working away this afternoon (not blogging, no sir), getting ready to make a quick trip to Atlanta for the [American Sociological Association's](http://www.asanet.org/convention/2003/) annual meetings and this guy comes in the doorâ€¦

I know this sounds like the start of a bad joke, but in fact it was [Tim Dunlop](http://www.roadtosurfdom.com/), who happens to be in Canberra at the moment. This was a pleasant surprise, not least because he managed to [find my office](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/000325.html), thereby proving himself to be a very clever man indeed. I only know Tim through his blog, so it was nice to put a face to the name.

As I say, I'm off to Atlanta tomorrow ([weather permitting](http://weather.yahoo.com/forecast/ASXX0023_f.html)) for the ASA meetings this weekend. Depending on what the hotel is like and how jetlagged I am, I may post some [DeLong-style](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/archives/001341.html) amateur conference ethnography. Unlike the AEA meetings, the ASA will have a number of professional ethnographers on the scene, though they may not be observing in their spare time. Possibly there'll also some reporters looking for a cheap August story built around papers with silly titles. We'll see.
