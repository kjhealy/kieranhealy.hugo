Early this morning my blog got a visit from someone at [cia.gov](http://www.cia.gov). They were searching for a information about an old article by the sociologist Erving Goffman called [On Cooling the Mark Out](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/blog/archives/000148.html "Kieran Healy's Weblog: Cooling the Mark Out"), which I blogged about a while ago. The article is about how con men gently close out a successful sting in such a way that the victim won't go and complain about it to someone. Good to see that the spooks are keeping up with their sociologyâ€”- and who knows, maybe even putting it into practice. Everybody should read Goffman at some point.
