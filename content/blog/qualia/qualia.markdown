Brad DeLong has a [post worrying about color perception](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/archives/001288.html "Semi-Daily Journal"), and in the [comments thread](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/cgi-bin/movable_type/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=1288), [D-Squared](http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/) correctly points out that you can't boil problems in the phenomenology of perception down to physics or biology.

This gives me a chance to link to [Dave Chalmers](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/), friend, philosopher, blog-reader and all-round qualia expert. Dave's book, [*The Conscious Mind*](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/book/tcm.html), will tell you about consciousness and qualia of all kinds (absent, fading, dancing, inverted, others). On the specific topic of color, Alex Byrne and David Hilbert's anthologies on the [Philosophy of Color](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0262024241) and the [Science of Color](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/026202425X) might be a good place to start.

Maybe I should make a new "Philosophy" category for this blog. It would probably annoy [real philosophers](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul) no end.
