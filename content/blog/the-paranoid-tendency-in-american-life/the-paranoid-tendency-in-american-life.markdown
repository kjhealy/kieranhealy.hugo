Driving home today I saw a guy standing by a busy downtown intersection holding a large sign that read, "9-11 Was An Inside Job." It doesn't quite rise to [seeing a giant muppet-like creature](http://monster-blue.blogspot.com/2007/04/i-am-at-complete-loss-to-explain-this.html) holding the same sort of sign, but maybe he's working on it.
