*Cosmic Variance*'s Sean Carroll doing a very good job indeed on The Colbert Report. That shit is hard. Along the way he makes deft use of a Dara O'Briain line ("Of course science doesn't know everything â€” if science knew everything, it would stop") that I believe I introduced him to, so therefore I take full credit for all the laughs he got and expect to receive a check for any royalties accruing from Colbert-related sales.
