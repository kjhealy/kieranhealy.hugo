I don't normally post this sort of thing, but here you go. Most weekends, if I can help it, I go mountain biking with [SAMBA](http://www.sambabike.org), a local club. Today was just one of those perfect Arizona winter days—- an absurdly sunny 72 degrees—- and we rode [Chiva Falls](http://www.virtualtucsonmagazine.com/vtmsections/oasispages/chiva.html), a moderately technical trail. We had quite a bit of rain earlier in the week and we were hoping the falls would be running. [They were](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/chiva2.html), and it was great: we got to see a 75ft-or-so waterfall in the Arizona desert. The trails in Southern Arizona are terrific. You don't need a fancy bike to enjoy them, though it does help. (Warning: gearhead moment approaching.) I'm the lucky owner of an [Ellsworth Truth](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/truth-1.html), a [very nice cross-country bike](http://www.mtbreview.com/reviews/2002_Full_Suspension/product_88337.shtml). (I bought used it from [John Pollock](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~pollock). No way would I have been able to afford a fully-kitted-out new one.) The Truth flies down singletrack, has better suspension than my car, and climbs like a monkey on acid. Beats sitting at my desk.
