Via [Jim Lindgren at Volokh](http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2008_07_20-2008_07_26.shtml#1216740927), some [article](http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/jul/22/carroll-gores-nutty-idea/) from the *Rocky Mountain News* about Al Gore's recent call for the U.S. to be fully running on renewable energy within a decade. The piece itself is hackery (though it does deftly compare Gore to Chairman Mao) but contains the following gem:

> Stanley Lewandowski, the general manager of the Intermountain Rural Electric Association, is one of the few utility officials willing to suggest that the prophet of global warming is strutting about like an emperor without his clothes. "Al Gore's statement of obtaining 100 percent of our power from renewables in 10 years has as much a chance of happening as the sun shining 24 hours a day," Lewandowski quipped. "It's nonsense."

Excellent.
