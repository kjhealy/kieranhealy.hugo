My usual few years behind the curve, I picked up Neal Stephenson's [Cryptonomicon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060512806/ref=nosim/) yesterday. Right now I'm about a hundred pages in, and I'm wondering whether I should keep reading. The prose is flat. Stephenson keeps lathering-in in chunks of his background reading. Much of that material is interesting, but it's applied with a trowel. Most of all, a strong whiff of [Mary-Sue](http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/004188.html) wish-fulfillment pervades the whole thing. Here is the author/soldier in Shanghai on the eve of the second world war, earning the respect of Nipponese soldiers by composing haikus, eating sushi and learning judo. Here is the author/genius talking about computability and mathematics with Alan Turing, impressing the hell out of him with his raw, untutored brilliance. Here is the author/unix nerd putting down a bunch of cardboard-cutout cult-stud poseur academics about the *real* meaning of the Internet. And so on. Does the book warm up at all, or are the next 800 pages more of the same? If the latter, I think I'd be better off finding some of the stuff Stephenson relies on for detail (like Andrew Hodges' brilliant *Alan Turing: The Enigma*) and just reading that, instead.
