To paraphrase [Nathan Glazer](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/067494836X), I guess we are all [cultural marxists](http://www.dixienet.org/ls-homepg/whats-new.htm#marx "The League of the South: What's New on DixieNet") now. (See [Atrios](http://atrios.blogspot.com/2002_12_08_atrios_archive.html#90053314) for some context.)
