Here is a very old joke. A soldier is captured during a long-running war and thrown into the most stereotypical prison cell imaginable. Inside the cell is another solider. He has an enormous, disgusting-smelling beard and has clearly been there a long time. The young soldier immediately sets about trying to escape. He is resourceful and possessed of great willpower. He bribes a guard with his emergency supply of cash. The guard gets him into a supply truck and he makes it to the prison garage, but is found during a routine vehicle search while exiting the compound. He is returned to his cell. His mangy companion says nothing about his departure or return. Undeterred, the young soldier works on the bars of the cell for weeks, filing them down with a shim made from a toothbrush. The whole time the old soldier looks on, silently. The young solider finally breaks the bars, slips out the window and makes it to the outer wall, where he is spotted and recaptured. He is thrown back in the cell. He glowers at his grizzled companion, who still remains silent. Calming himself and mastering his despair, he tries yet again, this time digging a tunnel with the narrow end of a broken plastic coffee spoon. After about two years of work he succeeds in escaping under the wall and making it to the nearest town, only to be captured again at the train station. He is delivered, once again, back to his cell and its taciturn occupant. At the end of his wits, the young soldier finally confronts the old soldier, shouting, "Couldn't you at least offer to help me with this?! I mean, I've come up with all these great plans—you could have joined me in executing them! What's wrong with you?" The old soldier looks at him and says, "Oh I tried all these methods years ago—bribery, the bars, a tunnel, and a few others besides—none of them work." The young soldier looks at him, incredulous, and screams "Well if you knew they didn't work, WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T YOU TELL ME BEFORE I TRIED THEM, YOU BASTARD?!" The old soldier scratches his filthy beard and says, "Hey, [who publishes negative results?](http://www.badscience.net/2011/04/i-foresee-that-nobody-will-do-anything-about-this-problem/)"
