I'm still in Austin at this conference. A sign on my hotel-room desk says that the bottle of Evian on top of my minibar will cost me $3.50 if I open it. My plan is to drink the water, go to the nearest convenience store, buy a replacement bottle for $1.25 and put it on the minibar. That way I make a profit of $1.75 on the deal, thereby maximizing value to this blog's shareholders.

(I believe essentially the same tactic netted Enron substantial benefits.)
