I'm having my least Christmas-like Christmas ever, mostly because I'm living in Canberra. I understand that it's unreasonable to expect Christmas to proceed as normal amidst the gum trees and sunshine, and of course there's a lot to be said for adapting traditions to fit the circumstances. At the same time, I can see why the first transplants from Europe held so grimly to traditions that were absurdly out of whack with their situation. I have a strong urge to light a candle and put it in the window, except Monday was the longest day of the year, so what's the point?

For someone brought up on a Northern-hemisphere Christmas, the uneasy Australian *detente* between the season and the Season (so to speak) is deeply unsatisfying. Even our two years in the high desert of southern Arizona were more genuinely festiveâ€”though warm it was still winter, and local adaptations like [Chili Wreaths](https://ssl4.pair.com/edmdubis/catalog/C3A.html) were much more creative than anything I've seen here. Australia might be better off if it just ditched the holiday altogether, perhaps replacing it with a full-on festival of the Summer Solstice. There must be something better than having the fake snow-covered pine trees, overheated Santas and In-the-bleak-Midwinters hanging on for dear life in the blazing sun.
