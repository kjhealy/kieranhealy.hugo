One of the sideshows that has accompanied the continuing collapse of Muammar Gaddafi's regime in Libya has been the parade of Western intellectuals and chattering-class heroes who, it turns out, were happy to take a nicely-reimbursed trip to Tripoli over the past few years, meet the Great Man, and then, in almost all cases, write a fawning article about the experience afterwards. Often these pieces appeared in quite high-profile locations such as *The Guardian*, *The New Republic*, *The Washington Post*, and so on. Thus, Anthony Giddens [embarrassed himself](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/mar/09/comment.libya) pitching the notion that under the tender guidance of Gaddafi Libya might one day become the "Norway of North Africa". [Benjamin Barber](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/14/AR2007081401328.html), [Joseph Nye](http://www.tnr.com/article/tripoli-diarist?keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true), and several others did much the same. [Robert Putnam](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703408604576164363053350664.html?mod=googlenews_wsj) took the bait but spat out the hook just in time, writing of his meeting with Gaddafi:

> Was this a serious conversation or an elaborate farce? Naturally, I came away thinking—hoping—that I had managed to sway Col. Gadhafi in some small way, but my wife was skeptical. Two months later I was invited back to a public roundtable in Libya, but by then I had concluded that the whole exercise was a public-relations stunt, and I declined.

Putnam clearly married well. He was also one of the few who publicly acknowledged that his participation was brokered by the [Monitor Group](http://www.monitor.com/), a consulting firm with a [large consulting contract](http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/0211/Among_Libyas_lobbyists.html) with Libya. In a report, [David Corn and Siddhartha Mahanta follow the money](http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2011/03/libya-qaddafi-monitor-group), showing how Monitor recruited a wide range of "thought leaders" to visit Libya and (in most cases) meet with Gaddafi. They link to an internal report, helpfully titled "[Project to Enhance the Profile of Libya and Muammar Qadhafi](http://motherjones.com/files/project_to_enhance_the_profile_of_libya_and_muammar_qadhafi.pdf)" detailing the recruitment program and the supportive articles that subsequently emerged from it.
