Gotta *love* [Brad Choate](google) and his [Textile 2](http://www.bradchoate.com/mt/docs/mtmanual_textile2.html) plugin[1], which makes it a breeze to write nicely formatted XHTML for your blog.[2] Now we just need an automated *content* generator, and &lowast;[[CT](http://www.crookedtimber.org)]&lowast; will run itself. ([Some bloggers](http://www.instapundit.com) show evidence of such a system already.)

fn1. Even footnotes. Brad developed Textile for Movable Type from [Dean Allen's](http://www.textism.com) original implementation.

fn2. The dangers of giving footnote functionality to [a blog](http://www.crookedtimber.org) staffed mainly by academics should immediately be obvious.
