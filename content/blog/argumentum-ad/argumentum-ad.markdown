[Glenn Reynolds](http://www.instapundit.com/archives/006121.php#006121) says

> THE [SADDAM / AL QAEDA LINK](http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/articles/2395416): Why are so many anxious to deny it? Perhaps because having missed it for so long would be embarrassing:

Someone teaching a rhetoric class could probably mine Instapundit for examples of
 [logical fallacies](http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0767417399/student_view0/chapter5/glossary.html "Critical ThinkingÂ |Â "). He seems especially prone to [begging the question](http://www.instapundit.com/archives/004561.php#004561), [ambiguity](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/blog/archives/000179.html) and (as in this case) attacking the motive.

Incidentally, the *reason* (rather than the motive) for denying a Saddam/Al Qaeda link till now was lack of evidence. *If* the article Glenn links to offers new evidence (and it's not very encouraging to have to depend on *[This is London](http://www.thisislondon.co.uk)* for your hard data, as opposed to, say, the White House), then that'll be a reason for people to change their minds. But you don't have to search for bad motives to explain why people didn't (or don't) believe there's a connection there. Besides, not wanting to believe something until there's good evidence for it is a good motive, not an embarrassing one.
