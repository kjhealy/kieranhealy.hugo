From a story in the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A47246-2002Jul10?language=printer) (seen on [Brad DeLong's weblog](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/)):

> 'According to Timesman Jack Malvern, liberal politician Shirley Williams—also known as the Baroness Williams of Crosby—recently recounted to an audience in Brighton that "my good friend Tony Blair" told her the following anecdote: "Blair, Bush and [French President] Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of the French economy. 'The problem with the French,' Bush confided to Blair, 'is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.' "'
