Architects like to think of their work as social theory made real. Conversely, paging through the examples in James Howard Kunstler's [Eyesore of the Month](http://www.kunstler.com/eyesore.html) is like reading a stack of freshman essays on Smith and Marx written by students who didn't do any reading and were too drunk to come to lectures.

Incidentally, I had no idea that the Dark Tower of Barad-Dur—eye of Sauron and all—is now located in [Nashville](http://www.kunstler.com/eyesore_200210.html).
