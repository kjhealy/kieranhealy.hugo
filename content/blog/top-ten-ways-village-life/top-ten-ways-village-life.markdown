 - 5. Cutting-edge methods of elementary school instruction designed to enhance discipline, focus, and respect.
 - 4. A property is internal if it is unthinkable that its object does not possess it, and is located inside the line demarcated on the relevant county plat map page.
 - 3. Feeding the duckrabbits is forbidden by local ordinance. 
 - 2. Whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must be silent after 10pm except on public holidays. 
 - 1. Slightly distressing sense of family resemblance amongst everyone you meet.
