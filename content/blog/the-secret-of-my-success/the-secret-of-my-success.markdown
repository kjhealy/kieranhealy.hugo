[John Quiggin](http://mentalspace.ranters.net/quiggin/archives/001038.html) is wishing for a custom menu in his wordprocessor with an option to "Convert Random Factoid and Sentence Fragments to Scintillating Prose." He is not being nearly ambitious enough. Thanks to a handy extension I picked up a few years ago, I have [all kinds of other productivity enhancements](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/menu-2.html) built into the applications I use. (I wish I knew who originally came up with this, by the way. Wasn't me.)
