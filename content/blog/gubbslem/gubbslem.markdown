Network theory is well-known for its evocative vocabulary, but sometimes what that language of structures and relations evokes can seem a little … antiseptic. Via [Jacob Christiansen](http://jacobchristensen.name/2008/03/30/slimed-geezers/), however, comes the excellent Swedish term *gubbslem*:

Superb.
