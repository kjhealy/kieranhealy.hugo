I was reminded this morning of an old Dotcom Era commercial from IBM. With some helpful prompting on Twitter, I eventually tracked it down. As you can see—pixelated video notwithstanding—IBM had some of the main concepts of Google Glass covered back in 2000, notably the clear presentation of the wearer as a jerk.

One of the standard jobs in software development these days is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design">UX Design</a>. User Experience covers "any aspect of a user's experience with a given system ... addressing all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users." Products like Google Glass make it clear that we should formalize the development process further to include what we can call "Experience of User", or <strong>XU Design</strong>. The XU Designer's job will be to assess and tweak how third parties experience the users of your product or service. Is the XU experience intrusive? Is it annoying? Do our product's XU Metrics all point in the direction of "Christ, what an asshole?" As the XU specialty develops we can trace its history back to phenomena like people loudly using cellphones in public, or people talking to you while wearing headphones, and the various ways norms and tolerances developed for these practices, or failed to develop. Right now, though, it looks like Google Glass is shaping up to be the leading XU Design disaster of our time.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to trademark the term XU Design and start a consulting company.
