Ari at [Edge of the West](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/01/23/help-rescue-anonymous-from-historys-dustbin/) asks,

> ... who's the most important â€¦ [American] historical figure about whom most people know nothing?

(I have edited the question slightly, because Ari is a historian and so writes 250-word blog posts that have five footnotes.) I don't have many suggestions, because I am one of the "most people" in this case and ipso facto know nothing about potential contenders. But in the comments someone suggests Philo T. Farnsworth. This reminds me of a conversation I once had with an American historian and a Russian computer scientist. It went something like this:

> American: ... but that's TV, I suppose. Philo Farnsworth didn't know what he was getting us all into.
>  Irishman: Who?
>  Russian: Who?
>  American: Philo Farnsworth. He invented the television.
>  Irishman: No he didn't. John Logie Baird invented the television!
>  Russian: Who are these people? Television was invented by Alexander Televishnevsky!

I forget the Russian inventor's real name. As I recall, further discussion established that for many 20th century developments the Russians had a counterpart developer who, according to the schoolbooks, had just gotten there before. And while this may seem like a standard bit of Soviet-era oddness, the phenomenon of simultaneous discovery in science well-established, together with [Stigler's law of eponymy.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler's_law_of_eponymy)
