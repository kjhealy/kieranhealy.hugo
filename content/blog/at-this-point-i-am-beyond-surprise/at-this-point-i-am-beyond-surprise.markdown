"The patient then was a 65-year-old drilling contractor, badly injured in a freak accident at his home. ... In 1988, however, there was no such fiery rhetoric as the congressman quietly joined the sad family consensus to let his father die. ... Doctors advised that he would 'basically be a vegetable,' [said the congressman's aunt, JoAnne DeLay](http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-delay27mar27,0,5710023.story?coll=la-home-headlines)."

The product liability lawsuit that followed, a class of tort which DeLay later described as "frivolous [and] parasitic," and sponsored a bill to outlaw, would be like an added bonus if this whole thing wasn't so sad and wrong.
