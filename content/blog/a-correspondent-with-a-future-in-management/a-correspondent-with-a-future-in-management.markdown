I just got an email from a stranger with a flair for delegation:

> Hello ,
>  I am a BSc student with the [X University] external program and a course that I am taking requires the reading of the book " Sources of Social Power volume 1 by Michael Mann " . Now while surfing i came across your email and i would like to know if you could give me a brief overview about this book and probably help me if i get stuck while going through it. I have just started reading this book and its a topic that i find really intresting and will be awaiting your reply.

Maybe I could write his final paper for him as well.
