I [missed this](http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/003265.html) earlier this week. No more MaxSpeak as of September 3rd. Boo. Max's posts felt like a very pure form of blogging: his prose style had a way of temporarily wiring you in to his thought process as it was happening. Not many people can convey that feeling well, either because there's too much post-processing (and it all gets polished up) or there's not enough (and its incomprehensible). Max hit the sweet-spot a lot more than most. The results weren't pretty, but they were usually dynamic, direct and right on target more often than not. Soon, the interwebs will be just a bit more boring.
