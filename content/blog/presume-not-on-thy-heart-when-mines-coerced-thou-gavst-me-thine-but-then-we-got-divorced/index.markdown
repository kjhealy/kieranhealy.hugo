[Donated Kidney is Center of Divorce Dispute](http://gothamist.com/2009/01/07/donated_kidney_is_center_of_divorce.php):

> A Long Island doctor is demanding that his estranged wife give him back the kidney he donated to her seven years ago. Dr. Richard Batista's lawyer Dominic Barbara says his client would also be satisfied with the value of the kidney: $1.5 million. Newsday reports that Batista married wife Dawnell in 1990 and that he donated the kidney in 2001. According to Batista, their marriage was on the rocks then, but "My first priority was to save her life. The second bonus was to turn the marriage around." Dawnell Batista filed for divorce in 2005. Dr. Batista told WCBS 880, "She had an affair, then would not reconcile, then handed me divorce papers as I was going into surgery trying to save another person's life.

All in all the very archetype of a wacky organ donation story, right down to the mandatory quote from Arthur Caplan.
