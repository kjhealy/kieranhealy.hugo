Via [Volokh](http://www.volokh.com/posts/1127939808.shtml) we come across the latest in a [long](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000426.html) [line](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000404.html#000404) of nonsense about whether the left or the right has a monopoly on virtue *x* or vice *y*. (Surely that should be vice *x*. Never mind.) This time it's [Ann Althouse](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2005/09/so-what-exactly-did-scorsese-do.html#112792822975605103) chancing her arm:

> To be a great artist is inherently right wing. A great artist like Dylan or Picasso may have some superficial, naive, lefty things to say, but underneath, where it counts, there is a strong individual, taking responsibility for his place in the world and focusing on that.

To which one can only say, piffle. In point of fact, *exactly the opposite* is the case. It's obvious that to be a great artist is inherently *left* wing. And why? Because although a great artist like Mozart or Pollock may have some superficial right-wing things to say about their purely individual genius and how they want to forge in the smithy of their soul the uncreated conscience of their race, underneath, where it counts, there is a goddamn parasite constantly sponging off of friends with real jobs and looking for handouts from the Emperor Joseph II, Peggy Guggenheim, the local Arts Council or what have you. QED.
