In the next week or two I'll be talking to some social science
students about tools for doing research and writing up results. Over
the years I've
[accumulated various things](https://kieranhealy.org/resources/) on the
topic, ranging from bits of advice to templates or things I use
myself. My focus is on managing the various pieces of the
[work process in plain-text](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2014/01/23/plain-text/),
especially when it comes to writing code you can read later, and
keeping track of the work you've done. When talking to undergraduates
or graduate students about this, and when teaching classes that use
these tools, I increasingly run into the problem that it's hard to get
started on this topic without backing up a bit first in order to talk
about how the computer they are using works.

I think reason for this is the rise of the flat-screen, touch-based model of
computing, most obviously on phones and then very secondarily on
things like Apple's iPad or Microsoft's Surface tablet. Now, most
people who need to write long documents (like papers or dissertations)
or work in an involved way with data do not use a tablet as their
primary device. But it does seem clear that some kind of touch-screen
interaction is the future of computing for most people. Indeed, once
you consider phones properly you realize it's the _present_ of
computing for most people. While it is not strictly impossible, it
remains very difficult to do your academic, social-science work on a
device of this sort. This is likely to be the case for some time. The
tools we have are not designed up for them.

That's not surprising. But I think there is an underappreciated
tension here. Two ongoing computing revolutions are tending to pull in
opposite directions. On one side, the mobile, cloud-centered,
touch-screen, phone-or-tablet model has brought powerful computing to
more people than ever before. This revolution is the one everyone is
talking about, because it is happening on a huge scale and is where
all the money is. In practice it puts single-purpose applications in the
foreground and hides from the user both the workings of the operating
system and (especially) the structure of the file system where items
are stored and moved around.

On the other side, open-source tools for plain-text coding, data
analysis, and writing are also better and more accessible than they
have ever been. This has happened on a smaller scale than the first
revolution, of course. But still, these tools really have
revolutionized the availability and practice of data analysis and
scientific computing generally. They continue to do so, too, as people
work to make them better at everything from slurping up data on the
web to presenting it there. These tools mostly work by gluing together
separate, specialized widgets into a reproducible workflow. They are 
"bitty" or granular because the process of data analysis is that way
as well. They do much less to hide the operating system
layer---instead they often directly mesh with it---and they also
presuppose a working knowledge of the file system underpinning the
organization of the things the researcher is using or creating,
from data files to code to figures and final papers.

The tension is that, increasingly, people who come in to the world of
social science wanting to work with data tend to have little or no
prior experience with text-based, command-line, file-system-dependent
tools. In many cases, they do not have much experience multi-tasking
in a windowing environment, either, at least in the sense of making
applications work together in the service of a single goal.[^1] To be
clear, this is not something to blame users for, and neither is it
something to complain about in misguided nostalgia for the command
line. Rather, it is an aspect of how computer use is changing at a
very large scale. The coding and data analysis tools we have are
powerful and for the most part meant to allow research products to be
opened up and inspected. But the way they work clearly runs against
the current of everyday, end-use computing, which increasingly hides
many implementation details and focuses on single-purpose tasks.
Again, specialized tools are necessarily specialized. The net result
for the social sciences in the short to medium term, I think, is that
we will have a suite of powerful tools that enable an amazing variety
of scientific activity, developed in the open and mostly available for
free. But it will get harder to teach people how to use them.
Organizations like [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org) have
begun to address this challenge in a very positive way. I think we'll
need a lot more in that vein in the future.
