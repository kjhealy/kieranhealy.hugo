Over at the Volokhs, Philippe de Croy [congratulates](http://volokh.blogspot.com/2003_03_23_volokh_archive.html#200033763) the *New York Times'* editorial judgment in moving Frank Rich to the Arts & Leisure section. Coincidentally, the Head Conspirator has been exercising a little editorial judgment [of his own](http://volokh.blogspot.com/2003_03_23_volokh_archive.html#200033008), sending [Clayton Cramer](http://claytoncramer.com/weblog/blogger.html) back to his own blog, after an exceedingly brief tenure as a contributor. In the words of Philippe, "Kudos! I have some additional suggestions for reorganization if they are interested."
