Just before lunch, I had the following conversation on the phone:

> [Phone rings]
>  KH: Kieran Healy.
>  Woman: Oh, so you are a man.
>  KH: Uh, yes, I am.
>  Woman: This is [someone] at the editorial desk of the *New York Times*. We referred to you as a woman yesterday in a post on our *Opinionator* blog. We'll change it now.
>  KH: Oh, OK.
>  Woman: Thank you. Goodbye.
>  KH: Goodbye.

The Opinionator is behind the Times Select Paywall, so I haven't seen the original reference or the corrected one. Someone else told me yesterday is was a quote from the [Brights post](http://crookedtimber.org/2006/06/25/dim-bulbs/).
