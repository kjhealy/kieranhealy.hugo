Via [How Appealing](http://appellateblog.blogspot.com/2003_01_01_appellateblog_archive.html#90188606 "How Appealing") I hear that [Disney beats Eldred](http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/business/4952857.htm). The sacred Disney patrimony of [wholly](http://www.snow-white-disney.com/) [original](http://www.houseofdisney.com/cinderelly/) cartoon [characters](http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/3991/robinhood.html), including the [goddamn mouse](http://www.bcdb.com/bcdb/detailed.cgi?film=3820&p=s) (also [completely original](http://www.filmsite.org/stea.html)) is now safe from the prying imaginations of artists yet unborn, yea even unto the third generation. Thanks to the Supreme Court, Disney can [continue](http://www.beautyandthebeast.com/) to produce more [wholly new](http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/neverland/) stories like the stunningly novel [Treasure Planet](http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/treasureplanet/).

Ack. My own views on this stuff are in papers which can be found [here](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/files/papers/jpp.pdf) [pdf] and [here](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/files/papers/culture-newecon.pdf) [pdf].
