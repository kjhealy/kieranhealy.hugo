I have a short contribution up about presumed consent and organ donation over at the [New York Times's *Room for Debate* Section](http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/should-laws-encourage-organ-donation/). If you are interested in following up some of the ideas, see [this blog post](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2008/04/09/psychology-vs-organizations-in-organ-procurement/) or [this law review article](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/papers/presumed-consent.pdf).
