I love America. Across its vast, extraordinarily diverse area, weird or stupid stuff happens all the time. And the [media are usually there](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=573&ncid=757&e=1&u=/nm/20040205/od_nm/life_hell_dc) to make it into a national story:

> A second-grade girl from Pittsburgh was suspended this week from her public elementary school for saying the word "hell" to a boy in her class. But 7-year-old Brandy McKenith says she was only warning the boy about the eternal comeuppance he could face for saying: "I swear to God."
>
> "I said, 'You're going to go to hell for swearing to God,'" Brandy was quoted as saying in an article that appeared on the Web site of the Pittsburgh Tribune Review on Wednesday. School officials were unavailable for comment. A Pittsburgh Public Schools spokeswoman told the newspaper that the student code prohibits profanity but does not provide a clear definition of what profanity is.

Lovely. Possible followups to this story: (1) Little boy also suspended for taking the Lord's name in vain. (2) School issues statement saying, "It's all been cleared up: We've explained to Brandy and the little boy that we were wrong to suspend them because, of course, Hell doesn't exist and neither does God." (3) President Bush issues statement that his No Child Left Behind Act will remedy "the unimaginative nature of profanity found in our public schools today." (4) Brandy handed additional suspension for violating her school's strict no-alcohol policy.

Normally I leave stories like this to [the Volokhs](http://volokh.com), who have a sweet tooth for them. But they are [busy](http://volokh.com/2004_02_01_volokh_archive.html#107600728006924720) at the [moment](http://volokh.com/2004_02_01_volokh_archive.html#107594714871232808) trying to [convince](http://volokh.com/2004_02_01_volokh_archive.html#107594380525038863) their readers that, whatever [Paul Craig Roberts](http://volokh.com/2004_01_25_volokh_archive.html#107532483671082814) thinks, U.S. taxpayers are not less free than [slaves](http://volokh.com/2004_01_25_volokh_archive.html#107532483671082814). Eugene Volokh has devoted about 10,000 words of his fine legal mind to this question, so far. He even wrote up a [helpful table](http://volokh.com/2004_02_01_volokh_archive.html#107600728006924720) outlining the relevant differences between 19th century U.S. slaves and 21st century U.S. taxpayers. I find myself wondering just what you'd have to say to get Eugene to write "Oh piss off, you ignorant little troll."
