According to [William Saletan](http://www.slate.com/id/2092275/), Al Gore's influence over people's hearts and minds is so strong that his endorsement of Howard Dean threatens to undermine the entire democratic process. Because Gore has asked that [Democrats fall in behind Dean](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/09/politics/campaigns/09TEXT-GORE.html?pagewanted=2), victory is assuredâ€”at the cost of voters' rights to express themselves at the polls.

With that sort of power at his command, it's a pity that Gore didn't think to endorse *himself* during the 2000 election campaign. It would have saved him a lot of trouble.
