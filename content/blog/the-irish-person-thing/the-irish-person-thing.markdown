For some reason someone thought this clip from *Rachel's Holiday* by Marian Keyes was something Henry and I should read. I can't imagine why.

> And although we didn't want to … we traipsed over behind him. Where we had to do the Irish person meets other Irish person abroad thing. Which involved first of all pretending that we hadn't realized the other was Irish. Then we had to discover that we had been brought up two minutes' walk from each other, or that we'd gone to the same school, or that we'd met on our summer holidays in Tramore when we were eleven, or that our mothers were each other's bridesmaids, or that his older brother had gone our with my older sister, or that when our dog got lost his family found it and brought it back.

I'm sorry to say this sort of thing happens all the time. For some reason—possibly due the combination of a small base population, large extended families, general nosiness, and the propensity to talk the leg off a donkey—Irish people are appallingly good at uncovering the normally invisible web of latent network connections that surround us. Out at Langley, teams of NSA analysts are using the most sophisticated computing technology to dredge through terabytes of data using fast homomorphic reductions, Markov graph regressions and Galois lattices in an effort to do what your typical Irish Mammy accomplishes by asking you two or three questions, taking a sip of tea and saying something like "Oh are you related to [your Aunt or Uncle's name here] then?"
