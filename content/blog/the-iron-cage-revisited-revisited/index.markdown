Next week at Arizona we're having a [Symposium and Mini-Conference](http://sociology.arizona.edu/ironcage/) to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the publication of [DiMaggio & Powell (1983)](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-1224(198304)48:2%3C147:TICRII%3E2.0.CO;2-S), which—as anyone reading this blog almost certainly knows—had something of an impact in sociology, organizations, and related fields. Paul and Woody will be in town to talk about their paper, and [Lis Clemens](http://sociology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/clemens.shtml) will kick off the discussion. I'm the moderator—playing Jon Stewart to all the actual stars, except without the good looks, nice suit, or team of writers to make me sound funny. The following day we'll have a mini-conference with contributions from [Frank Dobbin](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/dobbin/), [Diane Vaughan](http://www.sociology.columbia.edu/fac-bios/vaughan/faculty.html) and several other guests. A bunch of other great people are coming in just to be in the audience and enjoy the fun. So, if you want to hop on Southwest or JetBlue for a last-minute jaunt to sunny Tucson (I know you B-School people have the budget), come out and join us.
