Had I the heavens' enripened fruits,<br />
Abloom with their epicuticular wax,<br /> 
Cherry and sloe and chickasaw fruits,<br />
Blue damson, greengage, mirabelle snacks,<br />
I would make for you plum jam so sweet:<br />
But I, being peckish, ate yours while alone<br />
I have eaten the plums you kept out of the heat<br />
Tread softly because there may be a stone.<br />
