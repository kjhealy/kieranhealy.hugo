![ct-lineout](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/images/ct-lineout.png) Having John and Belle join us brings the [Crooked Timber](http://www.crookedtimber.org) roster to 15, which means we are now available for rugby matches against [similarly-sized](http://www.volokh.com) [group](http://www.crescatsententia.org/) [blogs](http://www.fistfulofeuros.net). Bring 'em on, I say. As you can see to the right, our front row is easily amongst the best in the world. Hooker [John Quiggin](http://www.johnquiggin.com/) is complemented by English hard-man [Bertram](http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plcdib/) and Welsh terror [Davies](http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/). Flankers [Weatherson](http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/homepages/weatherson/) and new acquisition [Holbo](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/) combine to ensure mobility amongst the forwards, while second-rows [Farrell](http://www.henryfarrell.net/) (H) and [Barlow](http://tedbarlow.blogspot.com/) are big enough to catch anything thrown at them in the lineout. Number 8 "Man-Mountain Micah" [Schwartzman](http://www.politicaltheory.blogspot.com/) anchors the forward line. Scrum-half [Farrell](http://users.rcn.com/erbnico/main_html.html) (M) provides the crucial link between the heavy-hitting forwards and the nimbler back line. At out-half, [Runnacles](http://trunnacl.org/blog) is equally well-able to run with the ball or kick for possession deep in opposition territory. Centers [Hargittai](http://www.eszter.com/) and [Waring](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/) are quick on the break while wingers [Brighouse](http://philosophy.wisc.edu/people/#brighouse) and [Mandle](http://www.albany.edu/philosophy/Faculty.html#mandle) create havoc with the slower defences of other blogs. Finally [Healy](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog) at full back is perhaps the only question mark in an otherwise impeccable line-up.

And in case anyone's wondering, rugby-team size seems to be optimal. Despite appearances to the contrary, and unlike the State or the Market (depending on your temperament), CT has no inbuilt tendency to expand indefinitely until it takes over every aspect of life.
