Tomorrow, [Max Sawicky](http://maxspeak.org/gm/archives/00001228.html "Weblog Entry - 06/04/2003: ") is leaving DC and travelling to [Tucson](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/camera/). I am leaving Tucson and travelling to Austin, for a [conference](http://www.utexas.edu/cofa/unesco/). Therefore, by the **law of conservation of bloggers**, which I just made up, someone must be travelling from Austin to DC. Step forward, whoever you are.
