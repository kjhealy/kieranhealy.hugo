Here's a snapshot of a [*New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com) article I was just reading. It happens to be about a drop in reading scores in New York Schools. (Ah, the irony.) Now look at the banner ad for [NYU](http://www.nyu.edu). Correct that second sentence as appropriate. (Also: Isn't "Anemona Hartocollis" a superb name?)
