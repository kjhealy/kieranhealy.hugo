Via [Unfogged](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_05_06.html#006758), a [hall of fame note](http://istherenosininit.wordpress.com/2007/05/07/most-outrageous-note-evar/) from a student:

> Dear Prof. AWB,
>
> I was in your British Literature class in the fall of 2006, and for that class, you gave me a grade of C. I need to have a better grade for this class. As far as I know, I got an 86 on the first paper, and I didn't complete the second assignment. I don't know what I got on the final essay or exam.
>
> I would like for you to change my grade to at least a B. If this means I must complete the second assignment, I will attempt to set aside time to do so. Please address this matter immediately.
>
> Thank you,

Bwahahaha! Actually, just this morning a colleague got an email from a student saying that he would "try to set aside time" to take the final (the time for which has been posted on the University's website all year).
