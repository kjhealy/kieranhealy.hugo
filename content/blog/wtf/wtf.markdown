I know I'm way late with this, but I must have missed it on my travels last month. The [Gadflyer](http://www.gadflyer.com) brings me [the story](http://gadflyer.com/articles/?ArticleID=131) that the Rev Sun Myung Moon had himself [crowned Emporer of the United States](http://www.gorenfeld.net/blog/2004/05/im-and-i-approve-this-messiah.html) and [declared the Messiah](http://www.jonsullivan.com/DiaryDetail.php?pg=1337&mat=ddef) at a ceremony in the [Dirksen Senate Office Building](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/32914) in [the presence](http://atrios.blogspot.com/2004_03_28_atrios_archive.html#108067610445417648) and with the [enthusiastic participation](http://www.gorenfeld.net/blog/2004/05/im-and-i-approve-this-messiah.html) of a bipartisan contingent of Members of Congress. No, really. Did this even make the newspapers?
