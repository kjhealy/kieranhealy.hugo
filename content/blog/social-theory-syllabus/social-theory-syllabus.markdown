I'm teaching graduate social theory this fall. Which is to say, next week. Here's a first cut at [the syllabus](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/teaching/gradtheory.pdf). Duke has a one- rather than two-semester theory requirement (though this is partially offset by the way my colleague Jim Moody teaches the Proseminar), which makes designing the course a bit tricky. I remain dissatisfied with the current version. Comments and suggestions are welcome.
