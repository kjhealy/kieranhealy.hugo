> **High Flight**
>  [John Gillespie Magee, Jr](http://www.callofduty.com/articles/highflight.html "High Flight by John Gillespie Magee, Jr")
>
> Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of earth
>  And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
>  Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
>  Of sun-split clouds and done a hundred things
>  You have not dreamed of—- wheeled and soared and swung
>  High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there,
>  I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung
>  My eager craft through footless halls of air.
>  Up, up, up the long, delirious burning blue
>  I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
>  Where never Lark, or even Eagle flew—-
>  And while with silent lifting mind, I've trod
>  The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
>  Put out my hand and touched the face of God.
