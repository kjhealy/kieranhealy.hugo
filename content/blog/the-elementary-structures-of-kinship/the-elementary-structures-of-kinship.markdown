Seeing as [the kids](http://crookedtimber.org/2007/05/17/justice-as-fun-ness/) are on the front page, indulge me a bit. My wife had a baby boy early yesterday morning (hurray!) and this morning I brought our three-year-old daughter up to see the new arrival. She has in principle been getting used to the idea of being a big sister for a while, and was excited to meet him. As we're walking in she says, "What is that thing on your wrist, Daddy?" "It's so that people here know that I'm your little brother's daddy," I said. She stopped walking and looked up at me. "But â€¦ but you're *my* daddy," she said.

Onward to sibling rivalry, I suppose.
