There's an [interesting article](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/22/science/22side.html?8hpib) in the *New York Times* today about [Elizabeth Willott's](http://research.biology.arizona.edu/mosquito/willott.html) work on mosquitos and the environmental ethics of wetland restoration. Elizabeth's in the Entomology department at [Arizona](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/camera/). Her other half is the philosopher [Dave Schmidtz](http://info-center.ccit.arizona.edu/~phil/faculty/dschmidtz.htm), and when Arizona were recruiting [Laurie](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul) and me, we stayed with them. It was the middle of December. The first morning we were there, we picked a grapefruit from one of the trees in their yard and ate it for breakfast. This effective recruitment strategy is not often used by universities on the east coast, for some reason.
