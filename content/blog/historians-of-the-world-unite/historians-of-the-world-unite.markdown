A group of well-known history bloggers—including [Timothy Burke](http://www.swarthmore.edu/Home/News/Media/Sources/tburke1.html), [Robert 'KC' Johnson](http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/johnson/), and [Ralph Luker](http://www.ralphluker.com/)—have banded together to form [Cliopatria](http://www.hnn.us/articles/1829.html). Proof if proof were needed that group blogs are continuing their irresistable rise to global dominance. Or, as a historian would put it, proof if proof were needed that at least one (probably quite atypical) group of historians launched what we can loosely refer to as a group blog (with all the difficulties that amorphous term implies) in late 2003 or thereabouts, according to the best available sources (but see below for further discussion on this point).
