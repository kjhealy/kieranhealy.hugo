I was interviewed recently by Brian Southwell for his public radio show, *[The Measure of Everyday Life](http://measureradio.libsyn.com)*. We talked for about half an hour, first about [Nuance](https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/fuck-nuance.pdf) and then a little about [performativity in social research](https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/performativity.pdf), and the ethical issues associated with it. You can [listen directly to the episode](http://measureradio.libsyn.com/the-dangers-of-nuance), find it [on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-measure-of-everyday-life/id956844695?mt=2), or through your [favorite podcast app](http://overcast.fm/).
