![image](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/images/lemmon-fire.jpeg) A large wildfire has been burning on [Mt Lemmon](http://www.azstarnet.com/~aflach/HIKE1.HTM), just outside the city. (On the right is a picture of a small part of it.) The fire has burned about 20,000 acres so far and still isn't fully contained. ([Click here](fire-diagram.gif) for a diagram of the fire's progress, courtesy of the [Arizona Daily Star](http://www.azstarnet.com).) Coming home from an evening bike ride out at [Gates Pass](http://emol.org/emol/tour/tucsunset.html) last night, we could see the fire glow from the Catalinas, and then the fire line itself. On the east side of the city, you can taste the smoke in the air. During the day, you can see the pall of smoke over the summit.
