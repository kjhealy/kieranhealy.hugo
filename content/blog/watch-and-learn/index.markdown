The other day Matt Yglesias [said](http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew/2006/06/world_cup.html) that the continuous flow of the game (and the fatuous American commentators) make it hard for him to learn what's happening in a soccer match. [Here's a masterclass](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhuRMiDz63w) from Argentina, who beat Serbia & Montenegro 6-0 this morning.

The clip doesn't even show the first seven or eight passes that led to this astonishing goal. The nice thing about it is that it showcases the virtues of one-touch passing and elegant finishing. This aspect of football isn't always obvious in the (undoubtedly impressive) 35-yard blasters that often make up highlights reels of best goals. Bear in mind that Serbia & Montenegro only conceded one goal in their ten previous qualifying games. For something comparable, you almost have to go back to [Carlos Alberto in 1970](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzmSmfw6WBg) (also [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HrjevD2vhk), from the other side of the pitch, which I hadn't seen before). Great stuff.
