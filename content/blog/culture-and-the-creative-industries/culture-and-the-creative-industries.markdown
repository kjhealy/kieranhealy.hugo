Finished a for-now-final version of **What's New for Culture in the New Economy?** yesterday. As I said before, it's a review that engages some of the recent work on creativity and innovation in the new economy (no such thing), the rise of the [creative class](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0205.florida.html), and the growing role of the creative industries. I'm pretty skeptical about a lot of these alleged trends. Grab the latest version [here [pdf]](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/files/drafts/culture-newecon.pdf).

Bonus item! Get a free [annotated bibliography](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/files/drafts/creative-economy-bib.pdf) on this topic, compiled by [Alan Schussman](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~schussma) and me. Now you don't have to do any background reading to survive at those creative industry cocktail parties your spouse keeps dragging you to.
