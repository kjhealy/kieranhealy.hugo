[Tim Dunlop](http://www.roadtosurfdom.com/surfdomarchives/001447.php) and [Jonathon Delacour](http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/2003/09/so_euphonious_to_me.php) wonder if whether some languages are more pleasant to listen to than others, whether you understand them or not. This is certainly true from person to person. When I moved to the U.S., I sometimes found that things I complacently thought were due to my natural wit and charm were in fact explained by my speaking in a pleasant Irish accent. Conversely, these days I am routinely berated by almost everyone for having lost that accent after a mere six or seven years in America.

The more general proposition—that some languages are *inherently* better-sounding than others—is usually just a step back before taking a kick at the Germans. But Clive James, I think somewhere in his autobiography, makes an elegant case for Italian. As I remember, he quotes this bit from Dante's [Divine Comedy](http://www.divinecomedy.org/divine_comedy.html) (*Inferno*, III, 1-3):

> Per me si va ne la città dolente,
>  per me si va ne l'etterno dolore,
>  per me si va tra la perduta gente.

"Through me you pass to the city of woe / Through me you pass into eternal pain / Through me to amongst the lost people."

Bitter words, James says, but because it's Italian you still get to say "*tra la*."
