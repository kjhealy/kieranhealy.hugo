A while back I noted the [disquieting resemblance](http://crookedtimber.org/2006/01/02/separated-at-birth) between the Emperor Gorg (of [Fraggle Rock](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009RQSSW/104-7889918-1956712)) and L. Ron Hubbard (present whereabouts unknown). Now my sources have alerted me to [this clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sH42MMepT4&search=muppet) from the short-lived [Muppets Tonight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muppets_Tonight). The premise of the clip is a look back at "The Kermit Frog Club," like the Mickey Mouse Club but with Kermit as the object of devotion and guest Cindy Crawford in the Annette Funicello role. (The MMC is outside the range of my pop culture: I have no idea what I'm talking about here.) Anyway, of interest are the muppet Frogsketeers, whose names are emblazoned on their shirts: along with Cindy, there's Newt, Stu, and â€¦ L. Ron. Now that I look at the screenshot again, Newt's crop of hair is also somewhat [evocative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newt_Gingrich).
