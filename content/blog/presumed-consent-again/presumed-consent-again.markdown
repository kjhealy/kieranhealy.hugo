Some [work of mine](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/papers/presumed-consent.pdf) on presumed and informed consent for organ donation has been picked up by Catherine Rampell at the New York Times' [Economix blog](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/how-can-we-encourage-organ-donation/). It's a good summary of the paper. I've discussed this stuff [before](http://crookedtimber.org/2008/01/14/opt-out-organ-donation-in-the-uk/) on CT, in the context of the possible introduction of a presumed consent rule in Britain.
