[Matthew Yglesias](http://www.matthewyglesias.com/ "Matthew Yglesias") serendipitously points towards [another manifesto](http://armedndangerous.blogspot.com/2002_10_13_armedndangerous_archive.html#83175091). Compare and contrast with the one I was talking about [this morning](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/blog/archives/000132.html#000132). Your answer should discuss the literary style, analytical power, political substance and likely staying power of each piece. Turn it in before 5:00pm on Friday. Late papers will not be accepted. Extra credit if you can identify the source of the song lyric that's the title of this post.
