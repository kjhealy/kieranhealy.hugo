Listening to the radio on an airport shuttle last night—some CBS news station, I think—I heard the presenter interview a correspondent about the new [videos and transcripts](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/02/national/nationalspecial/02katrina.html?ex=1298955600&en=0201f0653564ac8b&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) of the White House's response to Hurricane Katrina. At one point she asked whether this would make any difference to President Bush, or whether it was all "just water under the bridge." To be fair, she realized just before she said this that it might not sound quite right, but was trapped by the need to maintain the flow of talk. So she could only "I hate to use what may sound like an inappropriate metaphor, but …" by way of rescuing the situation. A little later she said it again, this time without comment. (It would have been better if she'd asked whether this controversy was now all blown over or a wash for the President, or something.)

This was a very mild version of the situations Erving Goffman analyzes in "Radio Talk", an essay from his book [Forms of Talk](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/081221112X/kieranhealysw-20/). The CBS announcer was unusual in that she flagged the problem with what she was saying. More often, as Goffman documents, the announcer ploughs on (often in deadly serious manner, to prevent the flow of talk from breaking down into giggles), as if daring the listener to think anything inappropriate has been said. Thus, "She'll be performing selections from Bach's Well-Tempered Caviar", or "Good evening, this is the Canadian Broad Corping Castration" are passed over in silence. It's better to push on, as efforts to save the interaction may end up doing even more damage, as in "Tonight I am going to consider the films of Alfred Hitchcack … *cock*! *CACK*!"
