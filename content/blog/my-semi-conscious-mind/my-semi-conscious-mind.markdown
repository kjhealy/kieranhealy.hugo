Following on from [last week's case](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/002867.html), which was concerned with the ontological argument, this week's nutter in [Laurie's](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul) Inbox gives us the complete and comprehensive solution to consciousness and morality, two perennial favorites.

> **The Essay (Forward this to all!)**
>  [Name Redacted to Protect the Innocent]
>  This universe is filled with atoms, unified into clusters or systems. They make up all things of matter from rocks to humans. All things of matter are either unconscious (a.k.a dead/ non living), semi- conscious (partially conscious), or fully conscious. Intelligence is the ability to be conscious. If one conceives, then one also sees an amount of right and wrong. **One always does what one truly conceives is right. When one does not conceive what is right, then one is blind and may do wrong.** Right and wrong will always exist as long as life exists. ...

Emphasis in the original, naturally. Onward:

> The condition of being unconscious is having no consciousness of all the worlds components, including right and wrong, at any given point in time (not being aware of anything) ... The condition of semi-consciousness is defined as not fully conceiving the world at any point in time. ... The condition of being fully conscious is being conscious of everything in existence at any point in time, past, present, and future (a.k.a all knowing). ... **The more conscious one is, the more likely one would be to make righteous decisions. The less conscious one is, the more likely one would be to make wrongful decisions.** The humans living on Earth, and all other living beings on Earth are not fully conscious.
>
> The following are not rules. They are statements that are **facts** (not mere philosophies) that my semi-conscious mind has conceived. ...

You can't make this stuff up. Apart from the semi-consciousness, I like the insistence on facts. Reminds me of the work of [another philosopher](http://hitch14.tripod.com/chapter_25.htm): "I am Vroomfondel, and that is not a demand, that is a solid fact! What we demand is solid facts!"
