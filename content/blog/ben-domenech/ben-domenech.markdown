The [Ben Domenech](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/redamerica/) plagiarism trainwreck is summarized nicely by [hilzoy](http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2006/03/plagiarism.html) at Obsidian Wings. (The discovery of an [entire column ripped out of a PJ O'Rourke book](http://yourlogohere.blogspot.com/2006/03/nail-meet-coffin.html) is the icing on the cake.) The two most entertaining things written about it so far are, first, the [in-the-bunker](http://redstate.org/print/2006/3/23/22434/5436) [defences](http://redstate.org/story/2006/3/24/03958/4019) being rolled out at RedState, and second, [this comment](http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/002481.html#comment-130231) at [Sadly No!](http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/002481.html)

A [couple of years ago](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2003/05/08/copycats) I wrote a post about kinds of plagiarism by college students:

> Like hepatitis, plagiarism comes in several varieties.

> 1.  Google Plagiarism. Find a paper or discussion online. Pros: Copy. Paste. Done! Cons: Professor may also know about Google.
>
> Sadly for Ben, the "may also know about Google" problem goes for thousands of bloggers as well. Never mind the joys of Amazon's "Search Inside" feature, which allowed for the lift from O'Rourke to be confirmed.
