Bill Frist is [damned out of his own mouth](http://billmon.org/archives/000281.html "Whiskey Bar: Doctor of Revisionism"), courtesy of some research from Billmon. I guess this is a good example of that "[revisionist history](http://news9sanantonio.com/content/top_stories/default.asp?ArID=2242)" that the president was talking about. This process is what [Ben Hyde](http://enthusiasm.cozy.org/archives/000165.html) calls the "internet acid bath."
