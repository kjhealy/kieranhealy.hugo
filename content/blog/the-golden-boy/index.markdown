![image](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/best.jpg) George Best has [died in hospital](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4380332.stm), aged 59. It's no surprise, of course: he drank himself to death over a long period. The Guardian has a [nice obituary](http://football.guardian.co.uk/obituary/0,16836,1650898,00.html) and [some photos](http://football.guardian.co.uk/gallery/0,8555,1647552,00.html). For those who don't know, Best was born in Belfast and was one of the most gifted players ever to play football. He was also an archetypal wastrel genius, spending just four or five years at the peak of his form in the late 1960s and then careening downhill. "I spent most of my money on booze, birds and fast cars," he said once, "and the rest I just squandered." A much-told anecdote has a hotel porter finding him drinking champagne on a cash-strewn bed with some starlet or other and asking, "Mr Best, where did it all go wrong?" The sad thing is that the porter was right.
 I'm too young to have seen him play, but old enough to have grown up seeing footage of his best moments and wanting to play football like him. The pathetic, drunken old wreck he became never quite overshadowed the brilliance he once had. Just look at the photo on the right. Or [this one](http://www.manutdzone.com/legends/BESTJUMP.JPG) where he's out-jumped players a lot bigger than himself. Or [this one](http://www.manutdzone.com/legends/best8.jpg), leaving a defender or two in the dust. Even in snapshots, he seems like he's moving.
