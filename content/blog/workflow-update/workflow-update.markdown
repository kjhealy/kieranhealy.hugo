Following on from [our discussion of editing tools](http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2007/12/13/the-right-tools-for-the-job/) the other day, and in response to a couple of requests, I have updated and somewhat expanded my note about [Choosing Your Workflow Applications](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/workflow-apps.pdf). The revised version talks about which operating system to choose (to a first approximation, these days I'm agnostic), focuses on Emacs+R+LaTeX as an integrated set of high-quality apps available for free across all the major platforms, and then points to some alternatives (like Stata and various editors). Perhaps of use, who knows. Suggestions for additions to the next version are welcome.
