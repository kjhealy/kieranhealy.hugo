I'm in Ireland at the moment, on leg \#4 of a round-the-world trip. Lead item on the news tonight, and lead story on the news analysis program afterwards, is Corkman and folk-hero [Roy Keane's](http://hjem.get2net.dk/mufc/squad/16.htm) decision to end the civil war in Irish football and [make himself available again](http://www.rte.ie/sport/2004/0413/keaneroy.html) for selection to the international team. After reaching the agreement, Keane's solicitor issued the following statement:

> Following discussions with [Brian Kerr](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/republic_of_ireland/2697905.stm) and [Alex Ferguson](http://hem.passagen.se/bully/Man_ferguson.html), Roy Keane has agreed to make himself available for selection international games in the future.

"[I tell you I have signed my own death warrant](http://www2.cruzio.com/~sbarrett/mcollins.htm)," Keane did not add.
