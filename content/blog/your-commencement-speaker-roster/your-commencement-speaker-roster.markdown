Successful commencement speakers are notoriously difficult to find. If you're not [boring people to death](http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2004/05/25/russert_bc_speech_stresses_values/) you are likely to be [ticking someone off](http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2004_05_21.shtml#1085451256). With this in mind, the **Crooked Timber Talent Agency** is pleased to announce its list of **2004-2005 Commencement Speakers** to the Administrations of all interested degree-granting institutions of higher learning, high schools, kindergartens, day-care centers and also right-wing think-tanks posing as any of the above. A brief selection of our speakers follows.

**Saddam Hussein**. *Bio*: Former President of Iraq. *Speech topics*: The glorious history of Iraq; the importance of law and order; outdoor living and survival skills. *General theme*: The importance of following your dreams; bouncing back from unexpected adversity. *Special Appeal*: Like Ted Nugent, but with broader musical fan base.
