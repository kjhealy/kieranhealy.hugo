Actually, more like Conference Rock'n'Roll. The [American Sociological Association's](http://www.asanet.org/convention/2003/) annual meeting got off to a decent start last night, with a performance in the main ballroom by a band called *Thin Vita*. It's made up of, amongst others, [John Sutton](http://www.catalog.ucsb.edu/2001cat/profiles/sutton.htm) (guitar/vocals) and current ASA President [Bill Bielby](http://www.asanet.org/governance/bielby.html) (bass). So I think Bill is pretty well top of the list of Heads of Social Science Associations That You'd Want To Have A Beer With. Towards the end of the night, my Ph.D adviser [Paul DiMaggio](http://www.princeton.edu/~dimaggio) appeared onstage as guest vocalist. Bielby and Sutton are at UCSB, which is a pretty relaxed place, and I've seen Paul perform before. But I have to say I got a fresh perspective on the Midwestern tradition of occupational mobility and stratification studies by watching [Bob Hauser](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~hauser/) and other Wisconsinites tear up the dance floor.

Now it's time to consult the brick of a program and figure out what sessions I'm going to go to.
