Various pieces of food for thought this morning. [CalPundit](http://calpundit.blogspot.com/2002_11_17_calpundit_archive.html#84674023 "CalPundit") makes a sharp observation about life in academia (where I live—- you know, the place [controlled](http://volokh.blogspot.com) by evil [postmodern](http://www.instapundit.com) relativist feminazis). [Junius](http://junius.blogspot.com) points to a great [post by Eve Tushnet](http://eve-tushnet.blogspot.com/2002_11_01_eve-tushnet_archive.html#84567296) about how to properly argue with your opponents. In essence, her point is to try arguing against actual people rather than labels. Although it's fun to write [hectoring essays demolishing straw men](http://www.dianahsieh.com/lectures/puoc.html), people have quotable views, whereas labels don't. And finally, [Drapetomaniac](http://www.backspace.com/common) occasionally [posts comments](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/blog/archives/000082.html) to my blog—- his blog, and the rest of [his website](http://www.backspace.com/) are very interesting to poke around in.
