Bouncing off of a [column by David Brooks](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/17/opinion/17BROO.html), [Matt Yglesias](http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/week_2004_04_11.html#003105) and [Patrick Nielsen Hayden](http://nielsenhayden.com/electrolite/archives/005031.html#005031) make the point that supporters of the war can't run away from the problems of its aftermath just because they personally might have done things differently, because frankly anyone who knew anything about both the Bush administration and the complexities of a war in Iraq could have predicted that it was going to be a mess. That means that post-hoc bellyaching that they didn't do it my way is a bit beside the point:

> David Brooks offers the first of what I think will be many retrospective [I was wrong but I was right anyway](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/17/opinion/17BROO.html) articles. The implication here is that though Bush may botch everything in Iraq, Brooks was nevertheless correct to have supported the war because he, after all, was not in favor of botching things.

Last July, I said [essentially the same thing](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/000267.html) in the context of the then-crumbling pretext for the war:

> Dan [Drezner] can be relied on to have made as well-argued and well-supported case for war as possible, but at this point I really don't care what it was, for the same reasons the hawks had no time for the "Not In My Name" line. The substance of the *President's* case for war is what matters … If that case was built on a series of lies — immediate threat, 45-minutes to deployment, uranium from Niger and all the rest of it — then that *is* something to get exercised about.

Seeing pundits like Brooks try to wriggle away like this reminds me of a joke that [David Lewis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher)) makes somewhere, viz, "You say you have a counterexample to my argument, but you must be misunderstanding me, because I did not intend for my argument to have any counterexamples."
