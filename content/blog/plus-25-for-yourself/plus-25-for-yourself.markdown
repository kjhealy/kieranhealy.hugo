Patrick Belton at OxBlog [disapproves](http://www.oxblog.blogspot.com/2003_10_19_oxblog_archive.html#106686610985015692) of the "Pope Death Watch" but can't resist linking to [the betting](http://www.online-betting-guide.co.uk/Next-Pope.htm) on JPII's successor, together with an analysis of the contenders. The main candidates are an Italian, a Cuban and a Nigerian, which sounds like the beginning of a pretty bad joke, the punchline to which is left as an exercise for the reader. I want the Nigerian to win, mainly because of the expanded possibilities for spam:

> REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE â€”STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

> Dear Sir, I pray this important message meets you in peace, may blessings of God be upon you and your family and grant you the wisdom to understand my situation and how much I really need your assistance. Before I start let me introduce myself, my name is [FRANCIS ARINZE](http://www.beliefnet.com/story/48/story_4829.html), Cardinal of the most holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, former President of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue and prefect of divine worship and discipline of sacraments. I have recently been elected Pontiff of the Universal Church by the conclave of cardinals, which you may have seen on the news.

> Upon accession to my office I found that the spiritual finances of the church were in a [difficult position](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1862598.stm) dues to the activities of [certain members](http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/2003/09/29/news/world/6881443.htm) of my predecessor's [staff](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/issues/2003-02-13/nelson.html/1/index.html). Budgetary measures undertaken by [an American auditor](http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=5245) have rectified the account sheet, but in the process they were forced to temporarily suspend the decision of [St Pius V](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12130a.htm) banning financial transactions in indulgences.

> As you are a learned person, you will no doubt be aware that the [Treasury of the Church](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07783a.htm) constitutes an inexhaustible fund which, via standard open-market operations, was easily sufficient to remit the debt. Due to the unexpected intervention of [St Anthony](http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Anthony/default.asp), however, we also turned up three [large trunks](http://www.crimes-of-persuasion.com/Nigerian/money_trunks.htm) filled with [devotional medals](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10111b.htm), last seen during the later years of the reign of [Boniface VIII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Boniface_VIII). Each of these medals is enriched with a perpetual [apostolic indulgence](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07788a.htm) good for the extra-sacramental [remission](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07783a.htm), *a culpa et a poena*, of temporal punishment due to one (1) mortal or ten (10) venal sin(s), and valued at approximately $125 million at prevailing exchange rates.

> These trunks are located in vaults of a security company in The Netherlands (Holland). I was contacted in a letter dated 12th of September by the security company asking me to indicate if I was in receipt of the letter as a sign that I am living and still subscribed for their service.

> I am interested in using a small fraction of this money, much less than
>  one percent for a re- organization of the work of God, plus some necessary payments to certain litigants in the United States, but I do not need the rest and do not want to have any direct dealing with it. But I need someone who will be able to use the fund better maybe for charity or something universally profitable. I have thought of doing it myself but, well, I am the Pope and a trip to Holland in the [popemobile](http://travel.guardian.co.uk/gallery/image/0,8564,-11504115622,00.html) might be noticed. I will be glad if you have any interest in the direction of maybe managing or transmitting the fund as you prefer in your capacity and understanding.

> I will be glad to get a response from you ASAP.

> Regards, FRANCIS ARINZE (Pope)
