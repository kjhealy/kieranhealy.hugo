Kevin Drum is [keeping score](http://www.calpundit.com/archives/002524.html) in an argument about data on global warming. "M&M" (don't ask me, I'm only reporting this) re-analyzed data for a [famous graph](http://www.calpundit.com/archives/002509.html) and claimed to find serious errors. Now, Kevin says

> Somebody it's not entirely clear who exported the original raw data to Excel but somehow exported 159 columns of data into a 112-column spreadsheet. M&M failed to compare the spreadsheet to the original data and thus produced a "correction" that was riddled with errors.

Here's something you can try at home: Walk up to a statistician, shake their hand and say "When I reanalyzed your data using [Microsoft Excel](http://www.practicalstats.com/Pages/excelstats.html), I found numerous errors." Stand well back. Wait.

It's all the worse, really, given that one of the best pieces of software for statistical computing is [available for free](http://www.r-project.org/). In fairness to [these guys](http://www.uoguelph.ca/~rmckitri/research/trc.html), though (and in response to a comment below from Kevin), I should say that data management is an often error-prone business that I've been bitten by myself. It'd be tough on them if an otherwise well-conducted reanalysis got tripped up because they used an incorrect version of the dataset.
