[Crooked Timber](http://www.crookedtimber.org) has officially started up. It's a new group blog by myself, Chris Bertram (aka [Junius](http://info.bris.ac.uk/~plcdib/)), the Farrells (aka [Gallowglass](http://www.henryfarrell.net/)), Brian Weatherson (aka [Thoughts, Arguments and Rants](http://philosophyweblog.blogspot.com/)) and serveral other fine people still TBA. I'm still figuring out what happens to this blog now that I'm affiliated with CT. I'll probably just duplicate my posts here (maybe a bit later) while I'm figuring that out.
