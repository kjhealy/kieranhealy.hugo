Here's a [short inverview/profile thing I did recently](http://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/good-question/kieran-healy/) for the "[Good Question](http://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/people/good-questions/)" series that the [Kenan Institute for Ethics](http://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/) has been doing. There was a high-concept photo-shoot and everything, so if you've ever wanted to see me hanging around in a junkyard warehouse surrounded by various spare parts (I'm sure you see the connection here), then now's your chance.
