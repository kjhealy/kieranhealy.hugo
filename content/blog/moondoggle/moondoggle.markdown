An interplanetary trial balloon is floated as [the AP reports](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20040109/ap_on_go_pr_wh/bush_space) President Bush "will announce plans next week to send Americans to Mars and establish a permanent human presence on the moon". "Bush won't propose sending Americans to Mars anytime soon;" the report says, "rather, he envisions preparing for the mission more than a decade from now." So it's not clear whether there will be an explicit JFK~~like commitment with a deadline ("The goal, before this decade is outâ€¦") or just increased funding with Mars as the long~~range but indefinite target. The report notes that "Bush has been expected to propose a bold new space mission in an effort to rally Americans around a unifying theme as he campaigns for re-election." I can think of more important things that Americans might rally around besides a manned mission to Mars, and better reasons for space exploration than a feel-good election-year promise.

Will the project be funded by a series of aggressive tax cuts? Will it alienate voters who think the Earth is 4,000 years old? Will the [Free State Project](http://www.freestateproject.org/) Libertarians ditch New Hampshire and realize that *this* is the chance they've been waiting for to *really* start again from scratch? Questions, questions.
