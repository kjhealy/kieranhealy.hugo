[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net) [twittered](http://twitter.com/gruber/statuses/781121060) the following:

> Suggestion for Gallup: how many Americans both (a) are offended by sermons of Obama's Christian pastor and (b) think Obama is a Muslim?

Which led me to check out this [Pew Center Report](http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=1277):

> The recent controversy surrounding sermons by Obama's former pastor, Rev. Wright, and Obama's March 18 speech on race and politics have attracted more public attention than other recent campaign events, according to Pew's weekly News Interest Index. Nearly eight-in-ten (79%) say they heard at least something about Wright's sermons (51% a lot, 28% a little) and about half (49%) have seen video of the sermons. ... There is little evidence that the recent news about Obama's affiliation with the United Church of Christ has dispelled the impression that he is Muslim. While voters who heard "a lot" about Reverend Wright's controversial sermons are more likely than those who have not to correctly identify Obama as a Christian, they are not substantially less likely to still believe that he is Muslim. Nearly one-in-ten (9%) of those who heard a lot about Wright still believe that Obama is Muslim.
