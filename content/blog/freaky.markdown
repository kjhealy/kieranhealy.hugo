I was browsing in the campus bookshop over lunch and saw the [UK/Australia edition](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/0141019018/) of [Freakonomics](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061234001/ref=nosim/kieranhealysw-20) for sale—this is the recently released revised and expanded version. Looking to see what had changed, I was surprised and gratified to see that the new version incorporates much of Steven Levitt's [response](http://crookedtimber.org/2005/05/23/response/) to [our seminar on the first edition](http://www.crookedtimber.org/category/levitt-seminar). The essay is prefaced by a generous comment from Steve to the effect that the CT seminar is the best available discussion of the book. Unfortunately the new edition doesn't contain our essays (though it does give the seminar's URL), and so we won't be getting any royalties for our efforts. This shows why traditional models of publishing are doomed in the era of free online content.
