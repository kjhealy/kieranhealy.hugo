Sick of [Battleground God](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000359.html#000359)? Take the IQ test at the [Center for the Study of Inequality](http://www.inequality.com/ "CSI : Center for the Study of Inequality") and see how much you know about income inquality, gender and occupational segregation, social mobility and other cool stuff. There are 12 questions. I got one wrong, but I suppose it's my job to know this stuff.
