Via [MaxSpeak](http://maxspeak.org/gm/archives/00001546.html) comes a link to an excellent [interview with Karl Marx](http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/ArticleView.asp?accessible=yes&P_Article=12295) conducted sometime in the last month, apparently. Karl has lost none of his vitality, despite having been dead for some time. His analysis is as trenchant as his invective is unrelenting. Who is an "insipid, pedantic, leather-tongued oracle of the ordinary bourgeois intelligence" and who is "so easy to comprehend, so stupendously unoriginal, so devastatingly tautological"? [Read it](http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/ArticleView.asp?accessible=yes&P_Article=12295) and see.
