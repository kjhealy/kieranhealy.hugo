David Adesnik posts [here](http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2004_08_15_oxblog_archive.html#109306453754409344) and [here](http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2004_08_15_oxblog_archive.html#109306102432801244) about the whole Swift Boat Veterans thing. The posts are funny:

> I still haven't gotten to the heart of the matter, which is who is telling the truth, the Vets or the Times. ... While it is hard to trust anyone's memories of events that happened thirty-five years ago, it is extremely hard to trust such memories when they're coming form individuals who had different memories of the same events quite recently … contemporary records confirm Kerry's account and Louis Letson, the army doctor who says Kerry lied, admits that "I guess you'll have to take my word for it" ... According to Larry Thurlow, one of the Swift Vets who witnessed the events in question, there was no enemy fire. However, the WaPo recently got a hold of the citation for Thurlow's Bronze Star (which he won during the same battle). In it, there are multiple reference to enemy fire. ... As I said before, **I haven't come to any firm conclusions about the Swift Vets accusation. My mind is still open** and I'll be happy to look at further evidence. But so far, things are looking pretty good for John F. Kerry.

Amazing. In his [earlier post](http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2004_08_15_oxblog_archive.html#109306102432801244) David even chastises those politically naive people who complain that the Ads are being funded by unscrupulous rich Republicans:

> But more importantly, who do you expect to fund anti-Kerry attack ads? The College Republicans? No, of course not. It's going to be rich and well-connected GOP backers who take it on themselves to be the President's hatchet men.

Sooo, the charges contradict the contemporary written records, they contradict previous statements by the SBV people praising Kerry's conduct, and hard-headed political observers like Oxblog know the only reason we're hearing any of these guys is that they're being financed by "hatchet men" for the Bush campaign. But don't expect us to make up our mind in favor of Kerry! For exit-strategy purposes, David's conceding that "things are looking pretty good" for Kerry but still, this is not the time to "come to any firm conclusions."

Look, if you don't like Kerry or have no confidence in the New York Times as a news source, or don't see anything wrong with unsupportable hatchet-jobs, let's just come out and say it, OK? But honestly—the kind of faux "open-mindedness" that refuses to draw warranted conclusions from the evidence is better left to [the Tortoise and Achilles](http://www.fecundity.com/pmagnus/achilles.html).
