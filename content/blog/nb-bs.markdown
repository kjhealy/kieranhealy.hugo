[Matt Yglesias](http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew/2005/02/hiatt_on_social.html) should be pleased to hear that Princeton University Press has re-issued Harry Frankfurt's well-known essay, "On Bullshit," as a small book. You can [buy it](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691122946/kieranhealysw-20/ref=nosim/) at Amazon. There's a [nice piece in the Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/14/books/14bull.html?ex=1266123600&en=32440f7c34fc8b0e&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland) about it, distinguished by the fact that the newspaper's stylebook forbids the word "bullshit"—though of course its pages are filled examples of the stuff—so it's referred to throughout as "[bull]" instead. As I think Matt's also observed, journalism would be serving its readership much better these days if it were possible to write headlines like "More Bullshit from White House on Social Security Reform."
