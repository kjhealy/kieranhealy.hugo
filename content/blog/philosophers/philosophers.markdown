Via [Jason Stanley](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2007/01/steve_pyke_phot.html), a link to some [now classic photographs](http://www.pyke-eye.com/philosophers_I.html) of philosophers taken by Steve Pyke, together with a [new batch](http://www.pyke-eye.com/philosophers_II.html) by the same photographer. [Here](http://www.pyke-eye.com/view/phil_I_05.html) is the much-missed David Lewis. [Here](http://www.pyke-eye.com/view/phil_I_07.html) is a terrific shot of Elisabeth Anscombe and husband Peter Geach. Amongst the new batch, [here](http://www.pyke-eye.com/view/phil_II_16.html) is Rae Langton. [Here](http://www.pyke-eye.com/view/phil_II_01.html) is Anthony Appiah. And [here is Jason himself](http://www.pyke-eye.com/view/phil_II_08.html), looking more intense than usual, and also unusually quiet.

Throughout the first batch and for much of the second, Pyke got the philosophers to provide a little statement about themselves and their field. Some are jokey, some gnomic, others quite straightforward. ([H.L.A. Hart:](http://www.pyke-eye.com/view/phil_I_09.html) "To be frank I think the idea of a 50-100 word summary is an absurd ideaâ€¦ I advise you to drop it.") Amongst my favorites is that of [Geoffrey Warnock](http://www.pyke-eye.com/view/phil_I_08.html), which elegantly captures the virtues that the analytic tradition strives imperfectly to embody: "To be clear-headed rather than confused; lucid rather than obscure; rational rather than otherwise; and to be neither more, nor less, sure of things than is justifiable by argument or evidence. That is worth trying for."

But if that's all too much for you, [here are some recent photos](http://knowability.googlepages.com/arizonaontologyconference) of philosophers having a blast pretending to be cowboys while riding uncertainly around on horses in the Sonoran desert. That's what they're *really* like, you know, moody black-and-white headshots notwithstanding.
