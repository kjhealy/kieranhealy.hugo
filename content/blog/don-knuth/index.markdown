Via [3QD](http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/), a nice [profile](http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2006/mayjun/features/knuth.html) of the great [Don Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/) who—amongst many other things—gave the world [TeX](http://www.ctan.org/), which, together with its [various](http://www.latex-project.org/) [descendants](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=XeTeX), helps make technical writing beautiful and encourages amateur typophiles to [waste their time](http://crookedtimber.org/2005/04/27/fetishizing-the-text/) formatting their [work](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/drafts/moral-order.pdf).
