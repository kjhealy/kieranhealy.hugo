This morning I cut myself while shaving. It was just a [superficial wound](http://apnews.myway.com/article/20040822/D84KGLT00.html), but as I was coming out of the bathroom the doorbell rang and there was this army officer in full dress uniform at the door. He presented me with a Purple Heart. I expressed some surprise but he just said "Standard medal-issuing [procedure](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2004/08/22/big_lies_for_bush?mode=PF), Sir," adding that his job had been made much easier by "the new Homeland Security Surveillance Cameras." I asked him did he want to come in for a cup of coffee, but he said he had to run down to Number 27 to award a Silver Star to a woman who'd just caught the pancake-batter bowl before it went all over the kitchen floor.
