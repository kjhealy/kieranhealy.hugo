As [Atrios points out](http://atrios.blogspot.com/2007_07_15_archive.html#162127958575664769) the Pope is indeed a Primate as well as a primate. This reminds me of watching RTE news years ago reporting on the death of [Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiach](http://www.answers.com/topic/tom-s-cardinal-fiaich), Primate of Ireland. The newscaster asked some talking head whether he preferred to remember the Cardinal as a man or a primate. I know which PZ Myers would pick.
