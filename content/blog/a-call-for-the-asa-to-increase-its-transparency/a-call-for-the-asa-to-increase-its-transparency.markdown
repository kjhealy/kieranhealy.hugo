There's now [a petition](http://asatransparency.org) at [http://asatransparency.org](http://asatransparency.org) requesting a better explanation from ASA for its [proposed dues increase](http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2011/03/24/the-dues-are-too-damn-high/), which would make the organization about the [most expensive social science association to join](http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/a-comparative-look-at-asa-membership-costs-and-benefits/) for people across the income spectrum. If you feel ASA should do more to explain and justify this increase to its members—which is of course consistent with either supporting or opposing the increase itself—please consider [signing the petition](http://asatransparency.org).
