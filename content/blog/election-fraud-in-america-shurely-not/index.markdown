[Yet another flaw](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/12/us/12vote.html?ex=1305086400&en=5b3554a76aad524a&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) has been discovered in Diebold's electronic voting machines. Company spokesman David Bear presents the watertight case for the defence:

> "For there to be a problem here, you're basically assuming a premise where you have some evil and nefarious election officials who would sneak in and introduce a piece of software," he said. "I don't believe these evil elections people exist."

This guy should get some kind of prize. America is the country that gave us the word [ratfucking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratfucking), where party operatives [jam the phone lines](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/phonejamming.php) of their opponents on election day, and where people say they want to die in Chicago so they can remain politically active.
