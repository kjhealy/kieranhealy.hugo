Another day of heavy traffic to this site, nearly all of it due to referrals from [Cursor.org](http://www.cursor.org). A commenter explained that it was because they were carrying Al Jazeera news in English, I think. In any event, I got more than 16,000 unique visitors. The comments section in the [CNN post](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000332.html#000332) is a real zoo, with nearly 200 contributors, most of whom are very angry one way or the other.
