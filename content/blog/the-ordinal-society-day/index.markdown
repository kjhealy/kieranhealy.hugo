It rained all day yesterday, but all of a sudden things brightened up considerably.

It's great to see it as a finished object. I am of course afraid to read it in case I immediately see a horrible typo. You can learn more about the book, read the first twenty pages or so, and even pre-order it (you should totally pre-order it) at its website, [https://theordinalsociety.com](https://theordinalsociety.com).
