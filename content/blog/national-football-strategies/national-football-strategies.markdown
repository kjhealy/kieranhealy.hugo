It's a well-established fact that a country plays football in a manner consistent with its national character. The strategies of major footballing nations for the World Cup show this is still true. Here's a run down on some World Cup plans that I got via email the other day. (Sorry I can't attribute the source: I don't know who came up with this.)

**The English Plan.**

Depending on the wind, the striker's position may vary.

**The German Plan.**

Radical, efficient, unstoppable. (Ball speed may reach 297km/hr.)

**The Italian Plan.**

Iron defense, small presence in midfield, passes to striker… and… Penalty.

**The Brazilian Plan.**

No comment.

**The Belgian Plan.**

Manage to lose game by themselves, no help needed.

**The Spanish Plan.**

Where's the Spanish plan?

**The French plan.**

In a plan designed by Roger Lemerre, they try all possible hypotheses. Note the player in the midfield trying to play by himself.

**The Portugese plan.**

The black dot most of the players are gathered around is not the ball. It's the referee.

**The Irish Plan.**

Went home on a plane last week.
