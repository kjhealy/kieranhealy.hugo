Some of the people at Brad DeLong's [Semi-Daily Journal](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/ "Semi-Daily Journal") thread about the [name discrimination study](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/archives/001253.html) are discussing trends in naming, and racial trends in particular. Sociologists have got that issue covered too. Take a look at Stan Lieberson's [A Matter of Taste](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0300083858), which analyzes trends in naming practices in the U.S. over a long period.

I'm doing a lot of cheerleading for my discipline this evening. But hey, it deserves it.
