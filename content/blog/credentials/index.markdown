Based on a letter I wrote this morning and plan to send this afternoon (once I look up the right address), from now on I'd like to be known as ['Nobel Prize-nominated](http://mediamatters.org/items/200503220009) blogger, Kieran Healy.' I'm up for consideration in Physics. I nominated everyone here at CT as well, except [Montagu](http://www.crookedtimber.org/author/montagu-norman/) because prizes aren't awarded posthumously. There aren't enough categories for us all to win in the same year (even counting [Economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize#Prize_categories)), but I'm sure everyone's turn will come.
