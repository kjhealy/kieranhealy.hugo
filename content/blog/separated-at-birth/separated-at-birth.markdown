![Visionary Leaders of our Age](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/eg-lrh.png) After viewing an episode of [Fraggle Rock](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009RQSSW/) with my daughter, I am led to wonder whether the Emperor Gorg (shown here on the left) bears rather more than a passing resemblance to L. Ron Hubbard (on the right). In the matter of bearing, demeanor and possession of the notion that they rule the universe, they are of course indistinguishable.
