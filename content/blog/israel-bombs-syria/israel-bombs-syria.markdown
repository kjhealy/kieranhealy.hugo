For the first time since 1973, Israel has [attacked targets in Syria](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3166768.stm). The attacks were in response to the most recent [suicide bomb attack](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3164380.stm) in Haifa. According to CNN, Israel's ambassador to the U.N. described the attack as a "[measured defensive operation](http://us.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/10/05/mideast.un/index.html)" aimed at destroying a training camp run by Islamic Jihad. Syria denies the camp was a terrorist base. It was certainly inside Syria, thoughâ€”about 14 miles from Damascus. I don't have much to say about this, other than to ask whether better-informed people than me think this is going to escalate Israeli-Palestinian conflict outside of Israel and the Occupied Territories.
