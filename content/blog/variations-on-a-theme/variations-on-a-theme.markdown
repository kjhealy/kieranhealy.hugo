We all know "Dog Bites Man" is not news, though it can be [poetry](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000311.html). The recent, widely-covered [Man Bites Dog](http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_773065.html "Ananova - 'Man bites police dog'") incident is the classic antithesis. In this case a drunken guy bit a police dog outside a bar. But what about the other permutations? **Bite Dogs Man**: Human-interest follow-up on the previous story: Man cannot shake bad reputation following the dog-biting incident and now has trouble finding work. **Man Dogs Bite**: Sympathetic profile of local postal worker. Alternatively, local resident is extremely persistent in his pursuit of the [perfect snack](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000311.html). **Bite Mans Dog**: For the first time in his short career, Able Seaman Bite is assigned on deck from [6pm to 8pm](http://www.sailnet.com/collections/articles/index.cfm?articleid=woodto0124). "I thought it was a prank at first," he says. **Dog Man Bites**: Another effort at genetic engineering is judged a miserable failure.

I could go on, but perhaps it's best not to.
