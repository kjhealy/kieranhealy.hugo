I missed this bit of DC think-tank inside-baseball yesterday. Matt Yglesias [wrote something critical](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/12/the_new_moderate.php) about [Third Way](http://www.thirdway.org/):

> Third Way is a neat organization — I used to work across the hall from them. And they do a lot of clever messaging stuff that a lot of candidates find very useful. But their domestic policy agenda is hyper-timid incrementalist bullshit.

Shortly thereafter, ~~GlaDOS~~ Jennifer Palmieri of the Center for American progress appeared from behind the scenes and posted to Matt's blog:

> This is Jennifer Palmieri, acting CEO of the Center for American Progress Action Fund.
>
> Most readers know that the views expressed on Matt's blog are his own and don't always reflect the views of the Center for American Progress Action Fund. Such is the case with regard to Matt's comments about Third Way. Our institution has partnered with Third Way on a number of important projects … and have a great deal of respect for their critical thinking and excellent work product. They are key leaders in the progressive movement and we look forward to working with them in the future.

Whoops. We are throwing a party in honor of your tremendous success. Please place the device on the ground, then lie on your stomach with your arms at your sides. A party associate will arrive shortly to collect you for your party.

Things now seem to have [returned to normal](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/12/third_ways_first_100_days_retirement_security_edition.php), with "weak tea" metaphors substituting for that stuff about "timid incrementalist bullshit."
