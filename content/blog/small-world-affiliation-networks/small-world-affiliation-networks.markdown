Speaking of [website gadgets](http://crookedtimber.org/2005/10/26/map-of-ct-readers/), yesterday I tried out [Library Thing](http://www.librarything.com), a service that lets you catalog your books online. Think of it as [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) for your books. About 70 percent of the books in my office are already in a [Delicious Library](http://crookedtimber.org/2004/11/13/delicious-monster/) catalog, which Library Thing can import, so I uploaded the lot. Like Delicious Library, the most obviously useful feature of a catalog is as yet unavailableâ€”namely, the ability to do a full-text search on the books you own. Something like Amazon's Search Inside. Maybe in the future there will be a way for applications like this to talk to Search Inside or [Google Print](http://print.google.com/).

In the meantime, Library Thing lets you explore an affiliation network. You're tied to other users through ownership of the same books, and in your [profile](http://www.librarything.com/profile.php?view=kjhealy) you can see who overlap the most with. It turns out that the user I'm closest to none other than [Chris Brooke](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~magd1368/weblog/blogger.html), of the Virtual Stoa. [He](http://www.librarything.com/profile.php?view=chrisbrooke) and I share 38 titles. This may partly be a size effect, as Chris has more than three times as many books cataloged as I do. But it may also index up our relative closeness in [Blau Space](http://icc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/13/1/263). Further evidence of affinity in tastes comes from the fact that [Chris's photo](http://www.librarything.com/profile.php?view=chrisbrooke) and [mine](http://www.librarything.com/profile.php?view=kjhealy) come from the [same source](http://www.planearium2.de/flash/spstudio.html).
