John Murtha says [get out of Iraq now](http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/pa12_murtha/pr051117iraq.html). C&L has [the video](http://www.crooksandliars.com/2005/11/17.html#a5913), which has a lot more powerful commentary in addition to the content of the statement. Personally, I'd like to see Dick Cheney tell Murtha (who spent 37 years of his career in the Marine Corps) to his face that he's [losing his memory, or his backbone](http://edition.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/17/cheney/).
