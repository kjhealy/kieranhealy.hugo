[Instapundit](http://www.instapundit.com/archives/005137.php#005137) in his wisdom links approvingly to a piece by [Michael Kelly](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38447-2002Oct29.html) that effectively dismantles a form of the "[chickenhawk](http://www.nhgazette.com/chickenhawks.html)" argument that, alas, no-one is making. [Matthew Yglesias](http://www.matthewyglesias.com/ "Matthew Yglesias") presents the chickenhawk argument in its correct and, at present, wholly unrefuted form.
