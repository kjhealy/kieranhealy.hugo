[ChatGPT 5 was released today](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5prvgw0r1o). 


> ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has unveiled the long-awaited latest version of its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, GPT-5, saying it can provide PhD-level expertise. Billed as "smarter, faster, and more useful," OpenAI co-founder and chief executive Sam Altman lauded the company's new model as ushering in a new era of ChatGPT. "I think having something like GPT-5 would be pretty much unimaginable at any previous time in human history," he said ahead of Thursday's launch. GPT-5's release and claims of its "PhD-level" abilities in areas such as coding and writing come as tech firms continue to compete to have the most advanced AI chatbot.


I had a chat with it. Yes I know the questions surrounding AI are tricky. But I do not pretend to address those here; I merely report the following conversation.

In fairness to GPT5, in my career I have indeed encountered PhDs with this level of commitment to their particular blueberry.
