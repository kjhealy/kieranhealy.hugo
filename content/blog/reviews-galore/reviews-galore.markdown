Articles from this year's [Annual Review of Sociology](http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/action/showForthcomingToc?journalCode=soc&area=production) are starting to appear online in advance of their hardcopy publication, and in a tasty new layout, too. It's a good year for people interested in social organization, economic sociology and culture. The essays include:
