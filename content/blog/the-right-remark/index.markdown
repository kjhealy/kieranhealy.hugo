I did a lot of [debating](http://www.debating.net/irishtimes/timeindv.htm) as an [undergrad](http://www.ucc.ie). (Though I don't talk about it now that I live in the U.S., because American college debating has, um, a slightly different vibe from the kind found in Ireland, the UK and Australia.) A lesson from all that public arguing is that, sometimes, the best way to cut the knees out from under your opponent is to [say almost, but not quite, exactly what he said himself](http://atrios.blogspot.com/2002_12_08_atrios_archive.html#90052414 "Eschaton - Middle 'C' on the Mighty Casio").
