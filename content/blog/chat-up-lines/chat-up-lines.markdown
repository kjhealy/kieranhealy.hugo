Obviously suffering from some sort of nervous exhaustion, Josh Chaftez is having a competition to find the [best Political Theory Pick-up Lines](http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2003_06_01_oxblog_archive.html#95191669). Here's my entry:

> It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the queen of France, then the dauphiness, at Versailles; and surely never lighted on this orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. Until now.

Just call me an [old-fashioned](http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/burke.htm) romantic. Kevin Drum, on the other hand, is taking [a rather more crude approach](http://www.calpundit.com/archives/001398.html).

**Update**: See [Dan Drezner](http://drezner.blogspot.com/2003_06_01_drezner_archive.html#95215785), [Matt Yglesias](http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/000678.html#000678) and the [Followups](http://www.kieranhealy.org/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&entry_id=444) to this post for more unlikely-to-succeed approaches.
