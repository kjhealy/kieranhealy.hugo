Via [Patrick Nielsen Hayden](http://nielsenhayden.com/electrolite/archives/002354.html#002354) comes yet another interesting goddamn [blog](http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/tburke1/), this time from a history prof at Swarthmore. My God, have you people no pity? Give it a rest with your pithy and insighful commentary already. I'm supposed to be writing articles, for crying out loud.

I think I'll be [distributing this](http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/tburke1/reading.html) to my students soon, in the hope that it will do them some good.

Interesting fact about Swarthmore: I think it produces more sociologists per capita than any other university in the world. I have no hard data on this, but there's a lot of anecdotal evidence.
