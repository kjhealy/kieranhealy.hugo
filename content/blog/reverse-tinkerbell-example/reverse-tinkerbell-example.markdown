David Post over at [the Volokh Conspiracy](%3Ca%20title=) has discovered the concept of self-defeating or 'suicidal' prophecies. The modern *locus classicus* of this idea (to coin a phrase) is Robert K. Merton's essay "The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action", published in the *American Sociological Review* in 1936 ([J-Stor Link](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-1224(193612)1:6%3C894:TUCOPS%3E2.0.CO;2-O)). [Here's an essay](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/UnintendedConsequences.html) by Rob Norton on the topic.

David also wants to coin a phrase and eventually settles on the "Reverse Tinkerbell Effect" to describe the phenomenon. In Peter Pan, the more you believed in fairies the realer they became. David says, "The **reverse** Tinkerbell effect,therefore, occurs when the more you believe in something, the more likely it is to vanish."

An example might be, say, the belief that there's a terrifically good reason to invade Iraq. The Administration's immense belief one exists seems to be making an actual reason harder and harder to observe.

Ahem. Sorry about that. Totally gratuitous. ;-)

Incidentally, Robert Merton (who's still alive and well and living on the Upper West Side, even though his first major publication appeared in 1934) has a [whole book](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/12296.ctl) about, amongst other things, how the same ideas keep getting rediscovered over and over again as time goes by.
