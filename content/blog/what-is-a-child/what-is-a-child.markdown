Talking about a post by [Amitai Etzioni](http://www.amitai-notes.com/blog/archives/000040.html), [Matt Yglesias](http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/002908.html#002908 "Matthew Yglesias") observes

> At any rate, I think it is true that most of the big liberal theories that have been articulated don't do a terribly good job of explaining how and why we should treat children, so maybe this shot isn't quite as cheap as I thought.

Let me immediately recommend my friend [Tamar Schapiro's](http://www-philosophy.stanford.edu/fss/tschapiro.html) paper ['What is a Child?'](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0014-1704(199907)109:4%3C715:WIAC%3E2.0.CO;2-X) [link is to [J-STOR](http://www.jstor.org)], which appeared in [*Ethics*](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ET/home.html%22) 109 (4), 1999, pp.715-738. Read it all up. It's good for you.
