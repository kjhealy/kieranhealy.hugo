The [responses](http://volokh.blogspot.com/2003_04_13_volokh_archive.html#200147168) to Eugene Volokh's [question](http://volokh.blogspot.com/2003_04_06_volokh_archive.html#200130813) are a bit disappointing. Most of them just restate the problem in a faux-Darwinian language of "signalling" that doesn't explain anything. Eugene's favorite answer—it signals lack of success for men but not women—doesn't tell you *why* the signal should have that meaning, just that it *does*. Nobody seems aware that there's rather a lot of research and thinking on the social organization of gender that might be of use here. At least Josh Chaftez, in [a related post](http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2003_04_06_oxblog_archive.html#92439681), noticed that ambiguity in sexual identity was more tolerated in women than men, *and* that the situation was different in antiquity. Hey, maybe that means …

Tell you what. Let me ask the same question a few different ways. (1) Why are the men [in this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/13/magazine/13UNEMPLOYED.html) prepared to let their wives take menial jobs but themselves just tend to sit around the house feeling sorry for themselves? (2) Are you surprised to find the [first same-sex kiss](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20030414/en_nm/leisure_kiss_dc_1) on daytime TV is between two women? (3) Why are women thought to have "[Work-Family Conflicts](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/%3CMTAmazonASIN%3E/%3CMTAmazonAssociateID%3E/ref=nosim/)," but not men? Perhaps not as exciting as Eugene's approach, but the same issue in its essentials.
