I'm at [CASBS](http://www.casbs.org) this year. The other day (for Halloween) I was given a list all of the occupants who have been in the office I now sit in. The list includes Jacob Marschak, Harold Wilensky, David Landes, Ernest Nagel, Philip Selznick, Alvin Gouldner, Robert Bellah, Ruth Barcan Marcus, Fred Dretske and Ron Breiger.

Crikey. I need to get back to work.

Other CASBS trivia: in 1957, Gabriel Almond, Ken Arrow, Kingsley Davis, Karl Deutsch, E. E. Pritchard, H. Stuart Hughes, Frank Knight, Karl Popper and Harrison White were all fellows at the same time. The following year, Talcott Parsons and Milton Friedman were there together. Parsons was two doors down from Ralf Dahrendorf. Friedman was next door to Claude Shannon. John Bowlby's office was next to Robert Solow's.
