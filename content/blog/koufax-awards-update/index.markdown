Head over to [Wampum](http://wampum.wabanaki.net/) and vote for your favorite blog named "[Crooked Timber](http://www.crookedtimber.org/)." We are nominated for [Best Writing](http://wampum.wabanaki.net/archives/000729.html), [Best Series](http://wampum.wabanaki.net/archives/000727.html), [Best Group Blog](http://wampum.wabanaki.net/archives/000725.html) and [Best Design](http://wampum.wabanaki.net/archives/000717.html). Unfortunately, the "Best Group Blog" and "Best Blog" categories seem mutually exclusive.

I just saw a [documentary](http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/LondonFreePress/Today/2004/01/18/316576.html) yesterday about the [Hollywood Foreign Press Association](http://www.hfpa.org/), the organization behind the Golden Globes. Apparently it's made up of people who need be neither foreign nor press, but who share a desperate desire to be photographed with celebrities. I will happily pose for a photo with anyone who votes for us in the Koufax Awards. Head and Shoulders shots only, though.
