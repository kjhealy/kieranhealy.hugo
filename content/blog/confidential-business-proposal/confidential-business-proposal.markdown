Dear Sir,

I know this letter will come as a [surprise to you](http://americablog.blogspot.com/2005/04/major-gop-scandal-developing-in-ohio.html), but suffice to say I got your email from a contact at the Department of the Treasury, who assured me that you are capable and reliable to assist me in this transaction. Before I go into details, I will first introduce myself to you. I am Mr. Joseph Abudulkarim Adisa, associate to [TOM NOE](http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050404/NEWS08/504040426), who is a prominent figure in the governing party of [OHIO](http://ohio.gov/) and Chairman of the U.S. Mint's Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. Our [rare coin company](http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050403/NEWS24/504030349) was entrusted with 50 (FIFTY) million dollars of public money since 1998, which we have used to buy various quantities of nickels, half-dollars, and gold dollars to sell to collectors or [lose in the mail](http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050403/NEWS24/504030349). Photographs of these holdings are available on request, to allay any questions you may have about our completely legitimate business enterprise. You will no doubt have heard of the recent [political instability](http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/) in the region, which has prompted an unjust and unfair [investigation](http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050406/OPINION02/504060368) by seditious elements intent on seizing ~~their~~ our assets, and they must be moved out of the state as soon as possible. I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualize this transaction.
