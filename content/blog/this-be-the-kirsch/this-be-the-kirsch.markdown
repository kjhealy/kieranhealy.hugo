They pluck your plums, your mum and dad<br />
They eat them for their supper, too<br />
They gobble all the fruit you had<br />
And leave some bullshit note for you<br />
<br />
But they were robbed blind in their day<br />
Of damsons, prunes, and blackthorn sloes<br />
Their breakfast treats were poached away<br />
And justified with old-style prose<br />
<br />
“Forgive us” both your parents moan<br />
“They were delicious, sweet, and cold”<br />
They wonder why I never phone<br />
And from them my own kids withhold<br />
