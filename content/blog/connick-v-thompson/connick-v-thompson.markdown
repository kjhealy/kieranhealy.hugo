J.K. Galbraith remarked that conservatism was engaged in a long search for a superior moral justification for selfishness. But that quest may sometimes become boring, or perhaps too difficult. Not to worry, because [occasions to be straightforwardly vicious](http://www.slate.com/id/2290036/) are more easily found, if you have the taste for it. Its spiteful tone aside, in substance *Connick v. Thompson* seems to be a [Lord Denning Moment](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2003/04/17/state-sponsored-terror/) for the U.S. Supreme Court. The conservative majority preferred to affirm an obvious wrong rather than face the [appalling vista](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Six#Charges_against_police_and_prison_officers) of a brutal and corrupt justice system. To be fair to the system, it's worse than that. Once the initial wrongdoing came to trial a jury, the district court, and the 5th circuit (twice) all decided the other way. It's only when we get to Thomas, Scalia, Roberts, Alito, and Kennedy that the system chose to [further institutionalize prosecutorial immunity](http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_impunity_of_the_roberts_court). Stitch-ups should be seamless: if someone could pull at a stray thread, the whole thing might unravel, after all.
