[Alan Schussman](http://www.schussman.com/article/1256/letters-to-the-editor-passing-in-the-night) reads the letters to our school newspaper, the [Daily Wildcat](http://wildcat.arizona.edu/), so I don't have to. The context is an effort by Republican state legislators to [require that a U.S. flag be displayed](http://www.tucsoncitizen.com/breakingnews/021506AZ_Schools_Flags) in every public school and university classroom. Tucson Democrat Ted Downing responded that "This is not the proper way to bestow patriotism. If we want we should spend more on teaching American history." Today in the [letters to the editor](http://media.wildcat.arizona.edu/media/paper997/news/2006/02/16/Opinions/Mailbag-1616232.shtml?sourcedomain=wildcat.arizona.edu&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com) a number of University of Arizona students provide evidence that he might be right. Here's Rob Monteleone (a senior), for example:

> It doesn't surprise me that someone who represents affirmative action wants to twist and distort the Constitution to suit the needs of poor, always-the-victim minorities. The Constitution was written so that all men would be treated equally. Whites, blacks and anyone else in this country â€¦ even the ones who don't belong here.

As Alan remarks, "I'd suggest Amendments 13, 17, 19, and 24 as starting points for Ted Downing's civics curriculum."
