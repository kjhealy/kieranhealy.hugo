The [Kansas Board of Education](http://www.cnn.com/2005/EDUCATION/11/08/evolution.debate.ap/index.html) has approved new standards that mandate the teaching of "Intelligent Design" (which I've always thought should be called [Paleyontology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Paley)) in science classrooms. According to CNN, in addition to mandating that students be told that some basic Darwinian ideas "have been challenged in recent years by fossil evidence and molecular biology," the board also decided to help themselves to a bit more, too:

> In addition, the board rewrote the definition of science, so that it is no longer limited to the search for natural explanations of phenomena.

Priceless. Unfortunately they didn't adopt my suggestion that science be further redefined to include sitting at home drinking a beer and watching the game on TV. This would have greatly enhanced my weekend contributions to science.
