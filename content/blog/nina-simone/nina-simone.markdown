[Nina Simone has died](http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-12293860,00.html "Headline news from Sky News - Witness the event") at the age of 70. Here's a [collection](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000046PQ) of hers that has some of her best recordings, including "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood", "Mississippi Goddamn" and the astonishing [I Put a Spell on You](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/clipserve/B0000046PQ001002/1/002-7882674-2488827). The clip doesn't do it justice: In particular, you don't get to hear her sing [And I don't care if you don't want me, I'm yours right now](http://www.boscarol.com/nina/html/where/iputaspellonyou.html). Brrr.
