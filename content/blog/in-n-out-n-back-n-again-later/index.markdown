[In-N-Out is opening a franchise in Tucson soon](http://www.in-n-out.com/location_details.asp?id=207), not too far from where I live. This may well pose problems for my, uh, ruthless nutrition and fitness regime. I'm not a connoisseur of American fast food, but In-N-Out is pretty damn tasty. [Sonic](http://www.sonicdrivein.com/index.jsp) is apparently also worth a bypass. I mean detour. Two locations recently opened in Tucson, but I've never eaten there. I think the last really good fast food chain I ate at was a while ago in Auckland, where I got to try the frighteningly large burgers and dangerously tasty kumara fries at [Burgerfuel](http://www.burgerfuel.com/flash.html), on Ponsonby Road.
