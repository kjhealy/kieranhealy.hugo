Tax Day is a good day to remember the late [Jeff MacNelly](http://www.macnelly.com's) classic [1040 Form](http://www.macnelly.com/editorial_images/macnelly_edtoon-1040form.html "MacNelly Editorial Cartoon") cartoon. The online version is just a little too low-resolution to fully appreciate, but I can't scan a better one because my copy is at home in Ireland, in a book called *The Gang of Eight*. I remember buying it in the late 1980s, but it took me till well after I got to the U.S. for grad school before I understood the joke about 'Filing Status' (the choices are 'Single', 'Double', and 'Sacrifice Fly').
