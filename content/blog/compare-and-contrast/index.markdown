The front page [summary](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/images/us-cap.png) of the lead story on CNN's [US edition](http://us.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/05/24/bush.iraq/index.html) reads:

> In a speech outlining the future for Iraq, President Bush warned Americans there would be "difficult days ahead and the way forward may sometimes appear chaotic," but added: "No power of the enemy will stop Iraq's progress." Bush outlined five steps to Iraqi self-government in the first in a series of addresses in the weeks before the handover of power to Iraqis.

The subheading reads ['Albright: More Specifics Needed'](http://us.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/05/24/albright/index.html). Meanwhile, the front page [summary](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/images/europe-cap.png) of the lead story on CNN's [European edition](http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/05/24/bush.iraq/index.html) reads:

> With approval ratings at new lows over Iraq and increasing doubts over his handling of the war, President Bush has outlined his five-step plan for the war-torn nation. Additionally, he says the U.S. will demolish the controversial Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad in consultation with a new Iraqi government.

Here the subheading reads, ['Bush approval near record low'](http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/05/24/bush.poll/index.html). Gotta cater to your audience.
