**Professor:** Here is your essay on Marx's theory of value. You got a C.
 **Student**: A C?! But I worked really hard on it for *two days*! That should be worth more than a C!

QED.

PS: I don't want any smarty-pants comments about labor values being properly measured in terms of abstract, socially necessary labor time, thank you very much. I know all about that. I still think this is funny.
