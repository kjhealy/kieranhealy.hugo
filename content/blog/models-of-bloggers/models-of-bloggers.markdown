[Henry](http://crookedtimber.org/2007/02/07/ip-law-and-bird-flu/) remarks that "my mental model of Tyler [Cowen] often sit[s] on my shoulder while I blog, making polite and well reasoned libertarian criticisms of my arguments." This follows on from Tyler's [own advice](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/09/the_phantom_me.html) to his grad students:

> You have a model of me, a pretty good one, and you know what I will object to and what will delight me. The Phantom Tyler Cowen objects, in your head, before the real Tyler Cowen has much of a chance. That is why the real Tyler Cowen is sometimes so silent.

*My* mental model of Tyler Cowen says, "This sounds like a rationalization to me." Meanwhile, [Brad DeLong asks](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/02/is_henry_farrel.html),

> Is Henry Farrell especially sane or especially insane?

for having a model of Tyler sitting on his shoulder making comments. My mental model of Brad DeLong says to my mental model of Tyler Cowen, "Why oh why are we ruled by this idiot?" My mental model of Eugene Volokh says, "This is much worth reading." But my mental model of Orin Kerr replies, "My sense is that this is much ado about nothing." My mental model of Bitch, Ph.D begins to object that she is not a brain on a stick before realizing that, being a mental model, in fact she is. Uniquely, my mental model of Drezner has his own mental model of himself, which he refers to as "Ed." Finally, my model of Cosma Shalizi has the unusual property of being smarter than I am. This ought to be impossible, but of course *I* can't understand its explanation of how this could be the case.
