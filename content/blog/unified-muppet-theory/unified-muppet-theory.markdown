In case you are searching for a unified account of Frank Oz Muppets in terms of the Big Five Personality Traits---and, to be clear, someone on the internet was earlier today---I'm providing it here for posterity. This version includes the "Henson Area", which is optional but both clarifying for the strictly psychological aspects and a bridge to a fully social theory of Frank Oz Muppets.
