So there's this ad for Guinn—never mind. Check out this [ad for Sony TVs](http://www.bravia-advert.com/), filmed last July in San Francisco. It consists of an awful lot of bouncy balls—about a [quarter of a million](http://www.bravia-advert.com/commercial/index.htmlavailable), in fact—bouncing their way down a hilly street. It looks great and is much more soothing than [high-speed drives through the streets of Paris](http://crookedtimber.org/2005/11/10/sacre-bleu/). There's a sixty-second version for [high-](http://www.bravia-advert.com/commercial/braviacommhigh.html) or [low-](http://www.bravia-advert.com/commercial/braviacommlow.html) speed connections, and a three minute version, also for [high-](http://www.bravia-advert.com/commercial/braviaextcommhigh.html) or [low-](http://www.bravia-advert.com/commercial/braviaextcommlow.html) speed connections. You need Quicktime 7 for the high-speed versions.
