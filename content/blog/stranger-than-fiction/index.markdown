Who knew that the book publishing world was [so full](http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/004041.html) of bizarre [criminal intrigue](http://www.sfwa.org/beware/general.html#Melanie)? If this were fiction, an editor would laugh at the absurdity of a villian whose alias was Melanie Mills but whose name in fact turned out to be [Roswitha Elisabeth von Meerscheidt-Hullessem](http://www.sfwa.org/beware/general.html#Melanie). Real life, having no moral to impart or plot to resolve, has no such difficulties.
