As always, the [Daily Kos](http://www.fishyshark.com/) has up to date information on Senate and gubernatorial races around the country. Recent gems include a summary of Jeb Bush's [latest bit of self-revelation](http://www.dailykos.com/archives/000338.html#000338), a post about a new [DNC-sponsored cartoon](http://www.dailykos.com/archives/000335.html#000335) about privatizing social security (and there I was thinking liberals are supposed to be no fun), and of course all the latest from As Jersey Turns.
