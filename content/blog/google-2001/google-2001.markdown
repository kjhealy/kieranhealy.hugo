Though it may have seemed impossibly far off in our hazy youth, these days we fondly look *back* at the turn of the 21st century and think that was when the world was new and fresh and everything seemed possible. Or searchable, anyway. For one month only, here is [Google's index, c. 2001](http://www.google.com/search2001.html). It shows that we [were](http://www.google.com/search2001/search?hl=en&q=chris+bertram&btnG=Google+Search) [present](http://www.google.com/search2001/search?hl=en&q=eszter+hargittai&btnG=Google+Search) [individually](http://www.google.com/search2001/search?hl=en&q=john+quiggin&btnG=Google+Search) though not [collectively](%3Ca%20href=). Besides nostalgia for this distant past, consider the results of searches such as "[housing bubble](http://www.google.com/search2001/search?hl=en&q=housing+bubble&btnG=Google+Search)" or "[subprime mortgage lending](http://www.google.com/search2001/search?hl=en&q=subprime+mortgage+lending&btnG=Google+Search)" or "[counterparty risk](http://www.google.com/search2001/search?q=counterparty+risk&hl=en&btnG=Search)."
