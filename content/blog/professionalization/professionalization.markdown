Posts about the academic labor market by the [Invisible Adjunct](http://www.invisibleadjunct.com/ "Invisible Adjunct") and [D-squared](http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2003_06_29_d-squareddigest_archive.html#105699484800973903) have focused my attention on my need for a better business card. In some academic fields, business cards are a taken-for-granted item of clothing. In others, they are a gauche acknowledgment that one is involved in paid labor of some sort. Sociology is somewhere in between. But what to put on the card, apart from the usual boring contact details? By far the best academic business card I've ever seen belonged to [Walter Sinnott-Armstrong](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~wsa/), whom I met a few years ago. As I remember it read, "Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, Professional Philosopher: Contradictions Revealed / Fallacies Exposed / Paradoxes Unraveled / Call for a quote."
