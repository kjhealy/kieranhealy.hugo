Via [Gillian Russell](http://www.logicandlanguage.net/archives/2005/07/top_ten.html) I see that the [results](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/greatest_philosopher.shtml) of the BBC's "Greatest Philosopher" poll are in. The winner—with 28 percent of the vote, more than twice the share of the philosopher in second-place—was Karl Marx. David Hume is next (just over 12 percent) and Wittgenstein third (6.8 percent). If you are upset that your favorite philosopher didn't win, why not listen to Randy Newman's [The World isn't Fair](http://www.randynewman.com/tocdiscography/disc_bad_love/lyricsbadlove), which also has a lot of useful information about Marx.
