I was at the [DMV](http://www.dot.state.az.us/mvd/driver/driverservices.htm) (or "MVD" as they say here) all morning, getting a new Driver's License. [Laurie](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul) came and got one, too. Because I am a worthless [foreigner](http://www.irlgov.ie), my license is good only for the length of my current visa. But Laurie got a regular one (her being a bona fide citizen and all). It turns out that Arizona basically lets you have the same license forever! Laurie's expires in 2041 or something. It's amazing they even bother to put the date on the card. I don't know why they do this. Perhaps the state doesn't want to bother issuing new licenses every five or ten years, like other states. Whatever the reason, it means that if you get a Driver's License in Arizona, you'll probably expire before it does.
