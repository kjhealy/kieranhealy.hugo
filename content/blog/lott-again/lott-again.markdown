If you've been [following](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/guns/lott98update.html) the John Lott saga, you'll know that its embarrassing sideshow is Lott's use of the pseudonym "Mary Rosh" to [defend (and praise) himself](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/guns/maryrosh.html) online. Amongst other things, "Mary" wrote an effusive [Amazon review](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/guns/maryrosh.html#1999-08-18) of Lott's book. Now that it's all become public, John Lott has done the honorable thing and [pointed the finger of blame](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8884-2003Jan31.html) for the review at his thirteen-year-old son. [Mark A. R. Kleiman](http://markarkleiman.blogspot.com/2003_02_01_markarkleiman_archive.html#90263782 "Mark A. R. Kleiman") comments, and hits the right tone of grit-your-teeth-in-disgust better than I can.

It's not unknown for the children of authors to praise their parents' books. Here, for instance, is [a review](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0674950895&itm=2) by Sarah Scanlon of *What We Owe To Each Other*, by the philosopher Tim Scanlon. I reproduce it in full:

> &lowast;&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;
>  **great job Dad**
>  This book is well worth the read if you have the time and the energy and most of all the brain power Hey I should know first hand the author is my dad.

This strikes me as absolutely the right way to write a review of your Dad's book. Compare and contrast to the [other one](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/guns/maryrosh.html#1999-08-18).
