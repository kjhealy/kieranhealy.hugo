I'm sure you're all tearing your hair out with frustration or worry, so I apologise for not posting much. For the past week I have been on a very tiny island on the south end of the [Rangiroa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangiroa) atoll, in French Polynesia. No internet access there. Also no electricity.

In other news, it turns out that if you write a book called [Last Best Gifts](http://www.lastbestgifts.com) then the website for it gets a *big* surge in hits from Google searches in the weeks before Christmas, but not because people are suddenly interested in the topic.
