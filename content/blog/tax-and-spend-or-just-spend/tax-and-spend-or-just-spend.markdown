About a year and a half ago, the White House floated the [moondoggle](http://crookedtimber.org/2004/01/09/moondoggle/). Remember that? Casting about for some legacy or other, Karl Rove came up with the idea of a permanent base on the moon. (And [a pony](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2004/03/if_wishes_were_.html).) At the time I wondered whether the initiative would be funded by a series of aggressive tax cuts. After the President's speech yesterday, it's clear that while the moon is no more (so to speak), the [payment plan for Katrina-cleanup](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=1133876) is the same. "You bet it's going to cost money," the President said, "... It's going to cost whatever it costs. Reported estimates are that it's going to cost at least as much as the War in Iraq has so far.

Meanwhile, White House economic adviser Allan Hubbard said the administration still plans to make the Bush tax cuts permanent, while at the same time 'cutting the deficit in half by 2009.' The White House Press Corps laughed roundly at this statement. No, of course they didn't. The President also proposed to create a [Gulf Opportunity Zone](http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/15/news/economy/bushzone/), which would provide subsidies to business, because [he said](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050915-8.html), "It is entrepreneurship that creates jobs and opportunity … and we will take the side of entrepreneurs as they lead the economic revival of the Gulf region." This reminds me of a comment I heard the economist [Geoff Brennan](http://socpol.anu.edu.au/brennan.html) make during a conversation about alternative forms of energy. Someone suggested that entrepreneurs should lead the way in this area, and Geoff agreed. They then said the government should maybe offer some subsidies or assistance to them as part of some program. "I think you have a different concept of entrepreneur from me," says Geoff. As [Max says](http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001610.html)

> If the city is cleaned up, its infrastructure restored, and flood protection established, there should be no need for subsidies to make business development flourish. On the other hand, individuals will need compensation to get on their feet again, including access to credit for business start-ups. Such access would not be a subsidy if it plugged preexisting holes in the market—the sort of red-lining that prevents solvent, lower-income people, especially minorities, from getting the loans they need and can repay to buy housing and start businesses.

And I'm not sure whether to hope he's right about this or fear that he is:

> However messy the use of money becomes in the hands of the Bushists, I maintain that this is a watershed moment for the limited-government movement. What we have in this Administration is an unwholesome mixture—the term toxic soup comes to mind—of Christian fundy prejudice (towards non-Christians, science, and the Enlightenment), Wilsonian jingoism, and blind anti-tax sentiment. Big, stupid government is all over your bedroom and your public schools, driving your kids further into debt, rattling an insubstantial sabre at a legion of emboldened international miscreants. These people will be the death of us all.
