[Malcolm Gladwell](http://www.gladwell.com/archive.html "gladwell dot com / Article Archive") is one of a few popular magazine writers who takes an interest in sociological research. Much of his book, [The Tipping Point](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316346624) draws on research on social networks and contagion. His essay on [Six Degrees of Lois Weisberg](http://www.gladwell.com/1999/1999_01_11_a_weisberg.htm) (which is also in the book) is good for introducing undegraduates to some basic ideas about networks. A little while ago, he published a short essay built around Eric Kleinenberg's [Heat Wave](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0226443213). And most recently, in last week's [New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com), he has an essay showing how ideas about creativity and social groups worked out in Randall Collins' gargantuan [The Sociology of Philosophies](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674001877) illuminate why Saturday Night Live was [so good in the '70s](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316781460).

The more of this sort of thing the better, I say. Good on ya, Malcolm.
