Unique vistors in February: 16,912.
 Unique visitors in March: 61,740.

Wow. Six months ago this blog was getting a few hundred visitors a month. If this were 1998, I could have IPO'd on that kind of growth.

Before I get too self-important, I should note that the vast majority of this month's traffic, though, went to [just one post](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000332.html) that was widely linked. Subtracting visitors to that page gives a figure closer to last month's number.
