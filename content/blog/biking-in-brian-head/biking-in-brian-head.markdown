I went mountain biking in [Brian Head](http://www.brianhead.com/), Utah, over the July 4th weekend. It was terrific. [John Pollock](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~pollock) organized the trip. Some photos from the trip are [available here](http://www.sambabike.org/ftp/samba/Brian%20Head/index.html). See the spectacular Utah mountain scenery, and also a bunch of bikers barreling through it.
