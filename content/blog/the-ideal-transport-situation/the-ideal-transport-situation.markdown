Laurie and I own a 1988 Volkswagen Quantum Syncro (just like [this one](http://bork.hampshire.edu/~josiah/vw/current/qsw4.jpg), only not as nice). During a rainstorm this weekend, water got into the left-side headlight assembly and blew the bulb. Looking online for some information about fixing it, I discovered that the [repair manual for our car](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0837603412) was co-authored by none other than [Jurgen Habermas](http://www.helsinki.fi/~amkauppi/hablinks.html), sociologist, philosopher and (until now) unacknowledged car mechanic extraordinaire. Several [reviews of the book on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0837603412/ref=nosim/broughsbooks/002-2430995-7929647) confirm that this is a superb "application of the theory of communicative action to issues of automobile maintenance" and argue that it is "Habermas's answer to *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*." How fantastically appropriate that he should have written the manual for a car jointly owned and driven by [a sociologist](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kjhealy) and [a philosopher](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul).
