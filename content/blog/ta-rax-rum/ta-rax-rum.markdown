I've just discovered [AtlanticBlog](http://atlanticblog.blogspot.com/ "AtlanticBlog"). It's by William Sjostrom, who describes himself as "an American economist living and working in Ireland." Working, in fact, at [University College, Cork](http://www.ucc.ie), my [alma mater](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kjhealy%22). So AtlanticBlog counts as another UCC blog, the only other one I know of. Though seeing as it's written by a Chicago-trained economist, it's composed of fundamentally different elementary particles from this one. William's [research page](http://www.ucc.ie/~sjostrom/research/index.htm) says he's working, amongst other things, on "rationality and the Irish voter". I will be *very* interested to see what the verdict is there. :) Another topic is "The Economics of Marriage and Divorce meets Public Choice: Explaining the Irish Divorce and Abortion Referendums," which I used to be very interested in. My former adviser, Paddy O'Carroll, has two classic papers in early issues of [Irish Political Studies](http://www.frankcass.com/jnls/ips.htm) on these topics. You'll learn a lot about Divorce and Abortion in 1980s Ireland by reading them. The references are: J.P. O'Carroll, "Strokes, cute hoors and sneaking regarders: the influence of local culture on Irish political style," (*IPS* v.2, 77-92); and J.P. O'Carroll, "Bishops, knights â€“ and pawns? Traditional thought and the Irish abortion referendum debate of 1983" (*IPS* 6, 53-71).
