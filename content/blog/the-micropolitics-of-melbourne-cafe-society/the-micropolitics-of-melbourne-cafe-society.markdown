We go into Trotters on Lygon St (highly recommended, by the way). It's busy, there's only one free table, and the middle-aged guy next to it has to tidy up the paper he's annotating so we can sit down. I'm chatting away to my (American) other half, possibly about the talk she gave at [Melbourne Uni](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/events/speakers.html) yesterday. Messy paper guy gets slightly agitated. He takes a few more notes, rummages in his bag and produces a copy of *Why Do People Hate America?*, apparently on general principle. It doesn't seem relevant to his note-taking. He leaves it on display on our side of the table. He doesn't make eye-contact.
