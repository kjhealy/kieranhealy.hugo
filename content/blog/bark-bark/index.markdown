That's the sound of [the talking dog](http://www.thetalkingdog.com/ "the talking dog"), who just appeared on my links list. This reminds me of that story the other day about the [dog who shot its owner](http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/025/nation/Man_accidentally_shoots_self_while_beating_dog+.shtml). Better be nice to the dogs.
