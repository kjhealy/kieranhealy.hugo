I know I link too much to [Brad DeLong's weblog](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/), but [this story](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/archives/000784.html) from the memoirs of Sandy Woodward, who commanded the Falklands Battle Group in 1982, is just too good to pass by.

It reminds me that I've been meaning to read Edwin Hutchins' [Cognition in the Wild](http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?sid=F5579052-B31B-4917-BF66-910C9619DD3D&ttype=2&tid=6047) for ages.
