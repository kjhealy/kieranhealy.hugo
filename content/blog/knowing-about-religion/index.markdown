Kevin Drum [is surprised to learn](http://www.calpundit.com/archives/003272.html) that schools in Britain offer religious education classes. (Ireland is the same, by the way.) He comments that "I don't think there's anything unconstitutional about teaching a "History of Religion" class or something like it in an American high school, but it just wouldn't happen. And then a proposal to add atheism as one of the highlighted religions? Kaboom!"

I've wondered before about this, in part because of a course in [Classical Social Theory](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kjhealy/teaching.php3) that I teach. I usually take a detour for a lecture before we read some [Max Weber](http://www.ne.jp/asahi/moriyuki/abukuma/), because a chunk of the class (upper-level undergraduates) will have no clear idea what the Reformation was. This surprised me when it first happened, but now I anticipate it. Last year I got a very nice evaluation from an evangelical Protestant student saying, in part, "Thanks for respecting my views and for all the information about where Protestantism came from! I never knew that!" She would wear "Jesus Loves You" t-shirts to class and really livened up our discussions about [Durkheim](http://durkheim.itgo.com/religion.html).
