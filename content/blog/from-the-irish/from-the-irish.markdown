It's St Patrick's Day, and I'm thinking about terrorism. So here is a poem from [James Simmons](http://www.pgil-eirdata.org/html/pgil_datasets/authors/s/Simmons,J/life.htm).

> **From the Irish**
>
> Most terrible was our hero in battle blows:
>  hands without fingers, shorn heads and toes
>  were scattered. That day there flew and fell
>  from astonished victims eyebrow, bone and entrail,
>  like stars in the sky, like snowflakes, like nuts in May,
>  like a meadow of daisies, like butts from an ashtray.
>
> Familiar things, you might brush against or tread
>  upon in the daily round, were glistening red
>  with the slaughter the hero caused, though he had gone.
>  By proxy his bomb exploded, his valour shone.
