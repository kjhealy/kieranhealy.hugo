Andrew Gelman with a [first pass at analyzing the election data](http://redbluerichpoor.com/blog/?p=206).

![04/08 swing by state](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2004_2008_actualswing.png)

This figure illustrates point 5 below—the election was more of a partisan swing than a redrawing of the electoral map. Andrew's impressions:

> **1. The election was pretty close.** Obama won by about 5% of the vote, consistent with the latest polls and consistent with his forecast vote based on forecasts based on the economy. ... **3. The gap between young and old has increased–a lot**: But there was no massive turnout among young voters. According to the exit polls, 18% of the voters this time were under 30, as compared to 17% of voters in 2004. (By comparison, 22% of voting-age Americans are under 30.)

> 4. By ethnicity: Barack Obama won 96% of African Americans, 68% of Latinos, 64% of Asians, and 44% of whites. In 2004, Kerry won 89% of African Americans, 55% of Latinos, 56% of Asians, and 41% of whites. **So Obama gained the most among ethnic minorities.**

> **5. The red/blue map was not redrawn; it was more of a national partisan swing.
