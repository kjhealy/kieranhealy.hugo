Influential upon myself, I mean. [Everyone](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/03/books-which-have-influenced-me-most.html) [else](http://jacobtlevy.blogspot.com/2010/03/ten-most-influential-books-see-tyler.html) [is](http://inmedias.blogspot.com/2010/03/influential-actually-published-actually.html) [doing](http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/2010/03/19/books-that-have-influenced-me-the-most/) it. I suck at lists like this. It's hard to give an honest answer, in part because I'm not prone to conscious conversion experiences, but mostly because I'm good at repressing things and so really find it hard to remember things I read that really hooked me at the time.

In any event, and in roughly chronological order:

1. Clive James, *Visions Before Midnight* or *The Crystal Bucket*. His TV criticism. I think I read one or other these when I was twelve or thirteen, having bought them on holidays somewhere. Not exactly Leavis or Empson, I know. But it taught me a lot about how to write, encouraged me to pretend I knew about the literary stuff James habitually referred to in passing, and I'm pretty sure helped make me an insufferable teenaged shit.

2. Steven Vogel, [*Life's Devices*](http://www.amazon.com/Lifes-Devices-Physical-Animals-Plants/dp/0691024189). Another random bookshop discovery. This is a book about biomechanics but also, and more importantly, a terrific introduction to what is means to do science. A lot of it went past me when I read it first, but it was still irresistible in part because (as I remember) it's written with this quiet wit right the way through. Chock full of trivia that isn't really trivia. Strangely enough, I think Vogel still teaches here at Duke. I should thank him personally for writing such a great book.

3. Bernd Heinrich, [*Ravens in Winter*](http://www.amazon.com/Ravens-Winter-Bernd-Heinrich/dp/0679732365). Another book by a biologist. (Are you seeing my imagined career path here?) Another classic book on the practice of science. Heinrich follows ravens around in Vermont, trying to figure out why the hell they would share carrion they find. I'd recommend this book to anyone.

4. Thomas Schelling, *[Micromotives and Macrobehavior](http://www.amazon.com/Micromotives-Macrobehavior-Lectures-Public-Analysis/dp/0393090094)*. So clever, so unassuming, so it made me want to be an economist. Then I took some economics and it wasn't much like Schelling at all.

5. Mary Douglas, *[Purity and Danger](http://www.amazon.com/Purity-Danger-Analysis-Pollution-Routledge/dp/0415289955)*. I think this book made me want to do sociology. Bluntly creative. Briskly suggestive. Deeply frustrating.

6. David Warren Sabean, *Power in the Blood: Popular Culture and Village Discourse in Early Modern Germany*. I don't know a damn thing about early modern German history, but I had to read this book very slowly, carefully and repeatedly as part of a Sociology of Community course as a third year undergraduate. I learned a tremendous amount in the process. The cases are fascinating: a girl branded as a witch; a man who refused to say his prayers; the ritual burial of a bull at a crossroads. The analysis is subtle: Sabean is excellent on the fine grain of relations between the State and the peasantry, and how religion and cultural meaning generally express these relations. But for me it was the first academic monograph I really grasped. In the process, I came to understand how hard it must be to write a book that good.

7. Pierre Bourdieu, *[Outline of a Theory of Practice](http://www.amazon.com/Outline-Practice-Cambridge-Cultural-Anthropology/dp/052129164X)*. I had to read chunks of it as a postgrad in Ireland, and as my reaction was one of constant irritation at Bourdieu's writing style coupled with the feeling that he was getting at something important. I reread the first few chapters recently and was struck by how direct (and properly documented) its engagement with the literature was in comparison with much of the rest of his work, so I guess professional socialization has had its effect on me. But I was also surprised that it was as compelling as I remembered.

8. Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, *[The Bell Curve](http://www.amazon.com/Bell-Curve-Intelligence-Structure-Paperbacks/dp/0684824299)*. This came out the year before I moved to the U.S. for graduate school. The book and the ensuing controversy around it taught me a lot about American academia, the wider world of the chattering classes in the U.S., the institutional structure that supported them, and the American public sphere generally. It wasn't a pleasant lesson. As a piece of social science the book was terribly executed and written in transparently bad faith; the social sciences in general and sociology in particular botched their response; the pressure of media narratives flattened people into parodies of themselves; and many people who I'd thought might have known better turned out to have a healthy appetite for eugenic tripe, as long as it was presented more in sorrow than in anger.

9. William S. Cleveland, [*Visualizing Data*](http://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Data-William-S-Cleveland/dp/0963488406). "This book presents a set of graphical methods for displaying data". Does it ever. Tufte gets the Presidential Commissions and the high media profile, and deserves all that, but Cleveland shows you how it's done in practice and wrote the software that lets you code it yourself. For me it opened up the world of serious thinking on  summary and model visualization for quantitative data.

10. Richard Titmuss, [*The Gift Relationship*](http://www.amazon.com/Gift-Relationship-Human-Social-Policy/dp/1565844033). Reading this wasn't a transformative experience in some existential sense, but it obviously left a mark seeing as I ended up writing a dissertation and a book that revisited its main questions.
