[Kevin Drum](http://www.calpundit.com/archives/001550.html "CalPundit") spots the *Guardian* asking various people whether Tim Henman can [win Wimbledon](http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,989081,00.html). Responses are generally negative.

Kevin says "The Brits sure are hard on their sports icons, aren't they?" They are. [Virginia Wade](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/wimbledon/bbc_coverage/2006651.stm) used to face this problem in the 1970s and '80s. As Britain's only decent tennis player, commentators would routinely say "Britain's hopes are pinned on Virginia." But as Clive James observed, having Britain's hopes pinned on you only slows you down.

Other pathologies of British sporting life include the magical way Irish athletes can be awarded British citizenship if they are doing well in international competition. No paperwork or ceremony is requredâ€”a special provision built into the [1922 Treaty](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Treaty) allows English sports commentators to award citizenship as needed during sporting events. Irish athletes can thus become British athletes with ease. Sports commentators are also allowed to revoke citizenship, and in particular may strip Irish football players of their passports as necessary. A related constitutional provision (dating back to the succession of James I) requires the Scottish football team to take on the role of "Britain's representatives" if England are ever knocked out of a tournament first.
