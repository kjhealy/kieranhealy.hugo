From [Overheard in New York](http://www.overheardinnewyork.com/archives/015985.html):

> **(family stands facing the empire state building)**
>  **Tourist son**: Mom, which one is the Empire State Building?
>  **Tourist mom**: I think it's the one with the circley top. (points to the Chrysler Building)
>  **Tourist dad**: No, honey, it's the one way out there, on the water.
>  **Tourist son \#2**: That's the Statue of Liberty. [To no one in particular:] I can't believe I'm part of this fucking family.
