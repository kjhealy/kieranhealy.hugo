Microsoft showcased the new features of [Windows Vista](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/default.mspx) (due for release late 2006) at [CES](http://www.cesweb.org/). Some people got a sense of [deja vu](http://www.apple.com/macosx/), so they took the Microsoft keynote speech and matched the audio demoing the new features to video from elsewhere. So now Windows users can see what exciting, innovative, ground-breaking features are coming in the areas of [the user interface](http://maclive.net/sid/134), and [smart search technologies](http://maclive.net/sid/135).
