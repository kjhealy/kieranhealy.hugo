[Savage Minds](http://savageminds.org/) is an elegantly-designed new blog run by six anthropologists. Its roster includes Alex Golub, whose site I used to read more often in the days before blogs, and who once [wrote a post](http://alex.golub.name/log/?p=28) containing the following story:

> Met with my advisor the other day to go over a conference paper I gave him that would eventually be turned into a chapter. He said that it was 'better than ok', which is the most positive comment I've ever gotten from him. Much better than when I was writing my MA, when he'd give me back drafts with comments like "don't ever give anything of this quality to me again ever".

I sometimes relate this anecdote to graduate students in order to preempt any passive-aggressive whining about my comments on their work being insufficiently kind and appreciative.
