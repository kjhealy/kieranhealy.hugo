I went to watch the Arizona Wildcats [beat Northern Arizona University](http://www.arizonaathletics.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=8107&SPID=516&DB_OEM_ID=1600&ATCLID=188035) in the first home game of the season last night in front of a happy home crowd. I've only been to one other American Football game in my life, so there was a whole novelty dimension. During the halftime show, as the [marching band](http://www.arts.arizona.edu/band/athletic/marchingband.html) played Led Zeppelin favorites and marched in complex, quasi-aesthetic formations (it looked and sounded like you might imagine), the [color guard](http://web.cfa.arizona.edu/colorguard/) drew a disproportionate amount of attention. (The color guard join in the band routines, twirling and throwing large flags. It looks tricky.) The color guard wore blue pants and sparkly, ruby-colored bustiers … except for one of them, whose whole upper body was covered in sparkly goodness. His presence was hard to miss, partly because he was the only male in the colorguard, partly because he was about twice the size of his fellow flag-bearers, but mostly because he twirled more effusively and pirouetted more extravagantly than anyone else. He flung himself *en arriÃ¨re* and *en avant*, he pirouetted under the posts and *jetÃ©*-ed across the fifty yard line. He was terrific. Some people in the crowd got a little wound up, apparently annoyed that a gender boundary might be in danger of subversion on the very altar of American masculinity's defining ritual. There were some catcalls and cries of "Get that guy outta there!" But mostly people loved it. And the guy himself could have cared less, blissed out as he was in front of 40,000 people, having reached a kind of camp Nirvana.
