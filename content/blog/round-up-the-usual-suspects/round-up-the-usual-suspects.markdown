Via [Sciatica](http://blindingnervepain.blogspot.com), here's a photo of [life in John Ashcroft's America](http://blindingnervepain.blogspot.com/2002_09_29_blindingnervepain_archive.html#85504761) that's relevant to what [MaxSpeak](http://www.maxspeak.org/gm) had to say [the other day](http://maxspeak.org/gm/archives/00000542.html). (The original Reuters photo is [here](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/020927/170/2c142.html).) Like Sam the American Eagle used to say, with a shudder, on the Muppets—- "You are all… Weirdos!"
