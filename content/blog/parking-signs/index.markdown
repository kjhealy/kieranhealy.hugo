If you want to print out a poster for [October 18th](https://www.nokings.org), here are two; fully-guaranteed countrywide but maybe especially suitable for in and around New York. 

{{% figure src="no-king.jpg" alt="" caption="No King Anytime sign" width="600" height="900" %}}

{{% figure src="two-term.jpg" alt="" caption="Two Term Limit sign" width="600" height="900" %}}

Here's a direct link to the [No King Anytime](no-king.jpg) JPG and the [Two Term Limit](two-term.jpg) JPG.  These are available as PDFs, as well (vector outlines; no worries about fonts): here's the [No King Anytime](no-king.pdf) PDF and the [Two Term Limit](two-term.pdf) PDF. Put them onna stick and exercise the constitutional rights to freedom of expression, speech, and assembly enjoyed by [everyone in the United States](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/06/28/american/).
