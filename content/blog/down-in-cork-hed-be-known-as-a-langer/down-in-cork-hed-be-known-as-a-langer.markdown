The best-selling song in Ireland at the moment is a strike for local terms of abuse over international ones. A group from [Cork](http://www.peoplesrepublicofcork.com)—Ireland's second-largest city, its real capital, and my home town—is dominating [the charts](http://www.rte.ie/2fm/charts/singles.html) with "The Langer," outselling such international cursers as [Eamon](http://www.mtv.com/bands/az/eamon/artist.jhtml) and [Frankee](http://www.frankee.com/furb.asp). "Langer" is a Cork term meaning—well, it can mean a lot of things, but [this clip from the song](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/oddments/langer.mp3) gives you the primary meaning. The song itself isn't destined to be a classic of contemporary folk music, but seeing as recent political events have caused me to use the word myself a few times to uncomprehending Americans, I can now point them towards this. The song is also notable for being the first with a full verse *as Gaeilge* to reach number one in Ireland. Appropriately the verse is about langers who think only they can speak Irish. Full lyrics are below the fold, courtesy of [The Cork Diaries](http://www.sparkpod.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/sparkpod.woa/wa/view?1010566).
 
 **The Langer**

Have you seen the old man
 The drunken ould lout
 Roaring and bawling and spilling his stout?
 And in everyone's business
 You'll first see his snout
 Down in Cork he'd be known as a langer

Chorus:
 A langer (Response: A langer)
 In Cork he'd be known as a langer

And our hero [Roy Keane](http://www.manutd.com/bio/bio.sps?iBiographyID=2539)
 Footballer supreme
 The finest this country and [Man U's](http://www.manutd.com/) ever seen.
 And we'd have won the World Cup
 But [Mick McCarthy](http://www.geocities.com/stevenedw/roykeane.html) fouled up.
 Roy was dead right to call him a langer!

Chorus:
 A langer (A langer)
 Roy was dead right to call him a langer!

And Johnny and Mick
 Have a Honda Civic
 With spotlamps and spiders
 And loud rock music
 Ah, but don't they look nice
 With the big furry dice?
 Would they ever stop acting the langer?

Chorus:
 The langer (the langer)
 Would they ever stop acting the langer?

Féach an phleice amach romhainn,
 ag bladairt trína thóin
 Níl gaelinn ag éine,
 dár leis, ach é féin
 Tá aige fomhraíocht sár-bhinn,
 's gramadach fíor chrinn,
 I gCorcaigh, gan dabht, sé an langer![1]

Curfa:
 An langer! An langer!
 I gCorcaigh, gan dabht, sé an langer!

From [Mitchelstown](http://www.mitchelstown.net/) to [Cape Clear](http://www.oilean-chleire.ie/)
 You'll be welcome down here
 For there's plenty of scenery, music, and beer
 But avoid the rugby weekend in [Kinsale](http://www.kinsale.ie/)
 For every year with out fail
 The town gets infested with langers

Chorus:
 With langers (with langers)
 The whole town's infested with langers

[This verse done in a posh Montenotte accent]
 In two thousand and five
 [Culture will thrive](http://www.cork2005.ie/)
 All along the green banks of the Lee (Shouted: Oh, good man, George!)
 But no matter what
 If you arrive on a yacht
 We'll tolerate absolutely nobody acting the langer
 (Shouted: Certainly not in [Crosshaven!](http://www.royalcork.com/))

Chorus:
 Langer (Langer)
 There'll be nobody acting the langer

George Bush and his boys
 Ah, did make your blood boil.
 Will they give the Iraqi people back their soil?
 Ah, and all of us know
 All he wants is their oil.
 Oh Lord, he's a ferocious langer!

Chorus:
 A langer (A langer)
 Oh Lord, he's a ferocious langer!

So three cheers for Roy Keane
 He's back wearing the green.
 Ah, what more could you ask him to do?
 So forget all the press
 And the whole bloody mess
 They're only a big shower o' langers.

Chorus:
 Langers (Langers)
 They're only a big shower of langers.

So there was me song
 I didn't keep ye too long
 For now ye all know one word of [Cork slang](http://www.corkslang.com/)
 And while there's meat on me bones
 I hope I'll never be known
 As a typical home-grown Cork langer

fn1. Look at the messer in front of us,/ talking through his ass, / Nobody can speak irish,/ in his opnion, but himself, / He's got perfect pronounciation,/ and perfectly accurate grammar, / In Cork, without a doubt, he's a langer.
