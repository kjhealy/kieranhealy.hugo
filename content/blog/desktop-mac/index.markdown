Hello to [Six Colors](https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/02/fun-with-charts-a-2021-report-card-breakdown/),  [Daring Fireball](https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/02/apple-in-2021-the-six-colors-report-card/), and [Upgrade](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/394) readers and/or listeners. Here's the SE/30 that I do all my work on. OK, OK, that I take occasional breaks on.

When I get a break from ~~Dark~~ ~~Castle~~ work stuff, I'll post something about the visualizations from Jason Snell's [survey of Apple pundits](https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/02/apple-in-2021-the-six-colors-report-card/).

PS, of course the real powerhouse machine is reserved for the home-office:
