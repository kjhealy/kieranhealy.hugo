Messing around with [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.com), the software that runs this weblog, I came across this very [nice hack](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000070.html#000070) to its capabilities. Movable Type is able to talk to Google, using the Google API. This little hack has each log entry automatically run a search on Google for the terms in the item titleâ€”- in this case, "Google API/Movable Type Hack". The results are then automatically stuck into the bottom of the log entry. As long as you use reasonably informative headlines, you get **five relevant links** dynamically generated at the bottom of the entry.

I feel there are **two kinds of people in the world**: the ones who fail to see the point/could care less about this sort of thing, and the ones who think it's a very cool. Looks like I'm in the latter category.
