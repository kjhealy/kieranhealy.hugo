I was driving home from the office this evening (yeah, yeah, I know—I prefer to think of it as Arizona taxpayers getting good value for money) and I saw this enormous Ron Paul Revolution limousine thing go by. It was as long as a semi. Arizona is McCain country, but there are also plenty of libertarians out here, and many of them are even opposed to state-sponsored torture. So it makes sense that Paul is doing a bit of campaigning in the vicinity.

Naturally, [there's a website](http://ronpaullimo.com/). Now that I look at the photo, it seems that it's more a glorified pickup-truck camper attachment than a limo as such. It seems like there should be a joke there about Paul's candidacy, or libertarianism, but it'd probably be too much of a—well, you know.
