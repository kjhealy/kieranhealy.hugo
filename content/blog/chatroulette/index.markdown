If you are one of the few remaining people not to have tried it out, [watch this movie](http://vimeo.com/9669721) or [this Daily Show clip](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/05/jon-stewart-chatroulette_n_486771.html) and then come back here. The rest of you know that Chatroulette is a human slot machine where pretty much every other round comes up with some guy abusing himself or demanding that any ladies within range expose themselves. As a trained observer of human behavior I was professionally obliged to investigate. Bearing in mind the second sort of modal user, I used the following image:

After that, the constant barrage of dangly bits became tedious, so I don't think I'll be doing that again.
