*Analysis* publishes a lot of relatively short papers, but [this one](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-2638(196606)26:6%3C208:ANOMB%3E2.0.CO;2-I)—by G.E.M. Anscombe—from 1966 seems close to the limiting case. The link goes to the JSTOR copy, which requires a subscription. No matter. I shall reproduce the paper in full here, including notes:

> **A Note on Mr Bennett** *By G.E.M. Anscombe*
>
> The nerve of Mr Bennett's argument is that if A results from your not doing B, then A results from whatever you do instead of doing B.^1^ While there may be much to be said for this view, still it does not seem right on the face of it.
>
> ^1^'"Whatever the Consequences"', Analysis, January 1966, p. 96.

That about settles it. (Indirect hat tip: Carolina Sartorio.)
