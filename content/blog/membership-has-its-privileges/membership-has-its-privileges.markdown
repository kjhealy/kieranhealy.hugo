 [Julian](http://www.sociolog.com/jdierkes/) got this invitation yesterday:

    Subject: NOT AN AD:  Invitation to Be a Fellow of the
    North American Academy of Arts and Sciences
    Date: Wed, 10 Jul 2002 15:48 -0400
    From: North American Academy of Arts and Sciences
    <invitation@academyofartsandsciences.org>
    To: Undisclosed.Recipients@Princeton.EDU

    You have been recommended by a Fellow of the
    North American Academy of Arts and Sciences
    to join our learned society as a Fellow.  The North
    American Academy of Arts and Sciences is a not-
    for-profit community of professionals from the
    various disciplines of the Arts and Sciences. Your
    Fellowship costs you nothing. To accept our
    invitation and become a recipient of the many
    benefits for which our Fellows are eligible, please

    http://www.academyofartsandsciences.org

    Your Invitation Code is:

    A19-18

    Thank you for considering the Academy's invitation.
    We look forward to welcoming you as a lifetime
    Fellow of the North American Academy of Arts
    and Sciences.

One thing we can be sure of is that, whatever it is, the [North American Academy of Arts and Sciences](http://www.academyofartsandsciences.org) is not the [American Academy of Arts and Sciences](http://www.amacad.org/).
