[Iain Murray has been sacked](http://englandssword.blogspot.com/2003_01_12_englandssword_archive.html#90189809 "The Edge of England's Sword") simply, it seems, for writing his blog, [The Edge of England's Sword](http://englandssword.blogspot.com). Iain worked for a think-tank in DC. The whole thing sounds very odd, really. Surely "you were writing a blog" is a pretext for some real reason for firing him—- perhaps some budgetary problems his employer is having? Think-tanks live on consultancy and grants, after all. I don't know. I tend to [disagree](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/blog/archives/000225.html#000225) with [most of](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/blog/archives/000097.html#000097) what Iain writes, but it seems absurd that he could get fired for writing about it on his lunch hour. I mean, *my* blog is currently hosted on a workstation owned by the University of Arizona. Perhaps I should get a hosting service instead…
