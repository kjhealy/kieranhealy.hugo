![image](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/forage.png) Back during the Katrina Disaster, we learned that whereas black people *loot* things *from* grocery stores, white people [*find* things *in* grocery stores](http://www.alternet.org/blogs/lfiles/24870/). Now that a container ship has [foundered off the English coast](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/22/world/europe/23britaincnd.html?hp&ex=1169528400&en=080d398c6b8cfbb0&ei=5094&partner=homepage) we can see what it is the English do under similar circumstances. Not looting, obviously (perish the thought). But not passive "finding," either. Truer to the Spirit of the Blitz, the Brits make the best of it and *forage*.
