[This report](http://edition.cnn.com/2005/EDUCATION/01/31/students.amendment.ap/index.html) of a survey of more than 110,000 (!) students at 544 high schools has been getting a lot of play. The survey found that one in three high schoolers think the First Amendment "goes too far"; that three quarters believe that flag-burning is illegal; and that 36% of them thought newspapers should get "government approval" before publishing stories in the newspaper.

The White House issued a statement congratulating American students not just for their views on constitutional law, but also for their "accurate characterization of the relationship between the Executive branch and the White House Press Corps."

OK, I just made that up about the White House. But the study is real. Further reading of the [full report](http://firstamendment.jideas.org/downloads/future_final.pdf) reveals the usual smorgasbord of opinion that surveys like this typically bring out. For instance, substantially more teenagers believe that "musicians should be allowed to sing songs with lyrics others may find offensive" than believe that "newspapers should be allowed to publish freely without government approval of stories." Even better, whereas only 49 percent thought that newspapers should be able to report without government approval, 58 percent said that *school* newspapers should be able to report controversial issues without the approval of school authorities. I guess it all depends on who you think The Man isâ€”the Prez or the Principal.
