Several years ago bumper stickers appeared that read "Annoy a Liberal. Work hard. Succeed. Be happy." I was living in Arizona at the time, so they became a routine part of my commute. Possessing neither the blunt empirical thesis of "Guns Bought Your Freedom" nor the slow fuse of "Body Piercing Saved My Life", the barefaced cheek of the *non sequitur* made the sticker absurd and irritating at the same time. I remember wondering what a parallel message to conservatives would look like. Sure enough, attempts at rebuttal soon started appearing on (other) bumpers. They were lameâ€”stuff like "Annoy a Conservative. Think for yourself. Defend the Constitution. Balance the Budget." Noble sentiments, but watery stuff by comparison.

Why did they seem so ineffective a response? Perhaps stronger material was needed. Might "Annoy a Conservative. Burn the Flag. Convert to Islam. Have an Abortion" work better? No. While that kind of thing can have some punch ("Jesus Loves You, But Everyone Else Thinks You're An Asshole"), it doesn't seem like the right tack. Instead, the best riposte to the "Annoy a Liberal" sticker is simply the same thing with the target swapped out: "Annoy a Conservative: Work. Succeed. Be Happy". The effect is more or less the same as the original, especially if placed on the back of your Lesbaru. Temporarily suspending my [longstanding](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2003/01/04/empty-questions/) [irritation](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2003/04/11/its-called-sampling-on-the-dependent-variable/) at divisions of this sort, much of what passes for "Pissing off Conservatives" is really an effort to rebut some ridiculous charge or other, instead of a genuinely symmetrical attempt to piss someone off. Or, as the story has Lyndon Johnson arguing, it's better to kick off the conversation in a way that forces the other guy to deny that he's a pig-fucker.
