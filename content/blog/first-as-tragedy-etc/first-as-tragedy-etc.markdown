[ABC news runs a story](http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/10/warnings_about_.html) under the headline "Warning Signs about Foley Ignored for at least Five Years."

> "No one in the Republican leadership, nor Congressman Shimkus, saw those messages until last Friday when ABC News released them to the public," said Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-IL). But there were lots of warning signs. In 2001, pages were warned to be careful with Foley. In 2005, one page complained to his congressman about "sick" e-mails from Foley, a complaint passed on to the Speaker's staff."

You can see how the story is taking shape. I expect soon we will learn of the existence of a Presidential daily briefing headed "FOLEY DETERMINED TO STROKE IN U.S. CONGRESS."
