[Mark Kleiman](http://markarkleiman.blogspot.com/2002_10_01_markarkleiman_archive.html#85546346) suggests two names to my list of interestin geconomists deserving of a Nobel. Thomas Schelling is a very good choice: [The Strategy of Conflict](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674840313) is a staple of Political Science, and [Micromotives and Macrobehavior](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393090094) is a superb book. It's instructive that one of the few negative reviews of hte book on Amazon says *both* "Is this really economics?" *and* "this book's content will be old-hat to anyone who has been trained to think like an economist."

Mark's other suggestion is [Tibor Scitovsky](http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/scitov.htm), who did revolutionary work in welfare economics, but who I'm not so familiar with. Unfortunately, Scitovsky [died in June](http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/report/news/june12/scitovsky-612.html), aged 91, and Nobels aren't awarded posthumously.
