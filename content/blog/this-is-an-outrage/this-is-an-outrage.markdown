It turns out that not [one](http://www.schussman.com/article/771/gadget-mail) but two of my students now have [Gmail](http://gmail.google.com/) accounts and I—I, what sits on their dissertation committees! I what gives them papers to grade!—do not. Appalling. I am investigating whether I can become a co-author on both of their Gmail accounts despite having done nothing to get one of my own. There's a lot of precedent for that kind of thing.

**Update**: Well, that didn't take long. Two readers generously emailed with invitations: [Alex Halavais](http://alex.halavais.net/news/) was first, so I took up his offer. Thanks very much, Alex and [Brad](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/). For my next trick I will publicly sulk about not having enough $50 bills.
