> I do not generally [*consider deleting, or move to beginning of sentence*] hold people in contempt ~~because of~~ **for** their profession, ~~their~~ job**,** or ~~their~~ calling. But copy ~~editors~~ **editing**! That is something [*Make consistent with either 'editors' or 'editing' in previous two sentences.*] different. Not as bad, I ~~will~~ grant, as war criminals or child molesters, they nevertheless belong in one of the very lowest categories of human intelligence**,** and indeed morality. You will [*consider 'may'*] object that copy editors perform a most useful and necessary function, turning ~~what is~~ ~~often~~ ill-formed and error-strewn text into something more presentable. This, too, I will grant. However, ~~it~~ **there** is no excuse for what ~~copy editors~~ **they** [*referent is clear*] also do - which is to [*run-on; consider breaking into two sentences*] interfere with people's painfully-crafted stuff [*lazy choice of word*] when there is no reason whatever for doing so, other than some quirk in the **^mind of the** particular copy-edit**or** ~~ing~~ ~~mind which is~~ at work.
