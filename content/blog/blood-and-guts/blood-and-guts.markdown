Organ donation is back in the news. CNN is running a story about a proposal to [test cash incentives for organ donations](http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/Northeast/05/31/organ.donation.ap/index.html "CNN.com - Group proposes testing cash incentives for organ donations - May. 31, 2003"). Maureen Dowd has a column about her niece who is that rarest of things, [a live liver donor](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/01/opinion/01DOWD.html). And in the blogosphere, John Quiggin [is complaining](http://mentalspace.ranters.net/quiggin/archives/001041.html) about a transplant-based example designed to show the problems with consequentialism.

All of which can mean only one thing: I need to finish writing my book. I'm in the process of revising my dissertation, *Exchange in Blood and Organs*, into something fit for the reading public. I've published a few papers from it already, like [this one](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/papers/embed-alt.pdf) [pdf] and [this one](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/papers/ts.pdf) [pdf]. Those are about blood. On organs, [one paper](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/drafts/insurance-rsage-final-web.pdf) should appear later this year in a Russell Sage volume. And right now I'm working hard to revise and resubmit a paper about the determinants of organ procurement rates in the United States.

I plan on finishing the book this fall and spring, when I'll be on leave at the [RSSS](http://socpol.anu.edu.au/) in Canberra. Although my advisor wants me to call it *The Political Economy of Blood and Guts*, it doesn't look like that title is going to make it to the final round of contenders.
