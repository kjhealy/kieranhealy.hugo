Matt Yglesias's book [Heads in the Sand: How the Republicans Screw Up Foreign Policy and Foreign Policy Screws Up the Democrats](http://www.amazon.com/Heads-Sand-Republicans-Foreign-Democrats/dp/047008622X) is nearing publication, providing further evidence that very long subtitles beginning with "How …" or "Why …", and which explain the main thesis of the book, are now completely entrenched in the U.S. publishing industry. It's the 21st century equivalent of the 19th century "Being a …" subtitle.

Anyway, the blurbs are up and the best one is from [Ezra Klein](http://ezraklein.typepad.com/), who wins the inaugural CT *American Blurbonomics: How to Praise your Friends while Surreptitiously Taking the Piss out of your Enemies* award. Klein says *Heads in the Sand* is "A very serious, thoughtful argument that has never been made in such detail or with such care."
