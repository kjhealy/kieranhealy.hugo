Like [Matt](http://www.matthewyglesias.com/ "Matthew Yglesias"), I also got interviewed by a journalist from the *Chronicle of Higher Education* for a story about blogging. I don't think I said anything I couldn't stand by in print, but who knows? I wouldn't be the first interviewee to be damned out of his own mouth:

> Junior faculty member Kieran Healy, soon to be formerly of the University of Arizona, initially said he only "spent a half hour or so over breakfast" on his blog each day but later hinted that he "wastes entire days polishing posts" and hasn't "written a scholarly word all semester." He went on to giggle uncontrollably for several minutes.
