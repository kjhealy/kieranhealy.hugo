For someone who runs a [weblog magazine](http://www.gawker.com) for terribly with-it New Yorkers, [Nick Denton](http://www.nickdenton.org/archives/003379.html#003379 "nickdenton.org: Advice for the Democrats") is just *so* six months ago with his approving link to a Tucker Carlson piece about [why Democrats need to be funnier](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/19/magazine/19DEMOCRATS.html?pagewanted=3). Didn't [someone](http://www.instapundit.com/archives/003798.php) already come up with this [lame idea](http://tedbarlow.blogspot.com/2002_09_08_tedbarlow_archive.html#81538846)? Honestly, when Knoxville leads Tribeca by the nose, there can be little solace in the usual high points of Manhattanite life, such as wearily [spotting Gabriel Byrne](http://www.gawker.com/03/01/003338.html) at a restaurant, having [pizza with pig fat topping](http://www.lockhartsteele.com/below14/archive/a_2003_01_01_index.shtml#90189374), voyeuring [Harrison Ford](http://www.gawker.com/03/01/003321.html) or [conversing with a self-absorbed cokehead](http://www.gawker.com/03/01/003089.html) so appallingly irritating that you want to have her arrested on general principle, never mind about the dope.
