So, where should you go to find [sociology rankings](http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2011/01/07/crowdsourcing-sociology-department-rankings/)? The NRC? No. U.S. News and World Report? Perhaps, if you also need to catch up on AARP-related news and events. Google, however, shows a new player in the game:

So there you have it. If you search for [sociology department rankings](http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&q=sociology+department+rankings) you'll find OrgTheory-related material is the first and third hit, with US News managing 2nd (for now) and NRC back somewhere in the dust.

We've now gotten about 65,000 votes on the [rankings page](http://www.allourideas.org/socrankings) Steve and I set up. Steve has done some initial analysis of the rankings, too, including [this visualization of the rank order as a network](http://www.stephenvaisey.com/socrankings/sociologysnake.jpg) where ties are defined by having an overlapping 90 percent confidence interval. The image and the data used to make it can be seen on [his site](http://www.stephenvaisey.com/socrankings/).
