Via [Karlo.org](http://karlo.org/), I found out about [MapBlast](http://www.mapblast.com)'s new way of mapping driving directions. If you've ever used [MapQuest](http://www.mapquest.com) or some similar service, you'll know the software spits out a street map with your route highlighted together with a table telling you where to turn and how far to drive along each segment of the route. MapBlast effectively combines these pieces of information by creating a [vector diagram](http://karlo.org/archives/images/mapblastlinedrve.php) of the route. The relative scale of each leg is not built into the map scale, but is provided as a number on each segment. The principle is similar to the [map of the London Underground](http://www.thetube.com/content/history/map.asp), which presents a stylized picture of the geography in order to focus the rider's attention on what's important: the relations between the nodes (the tube stations). The same thing is true of the LineDrive maps. What matters are the decision points—- where to turn, and which way—- and the vector diagram captures these very nicely.
