[Troutgirl](http://www.troutworks.com/Joycelog/2003_blogindex.php) (aka [Joyce Park](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/076454716X/)) has some [informed commentary](http://www.troutworks.com/Joycelog/joycelog.php?joycedate=20030705) on my [draft paper](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/drafts/oss-activity.pdf) [pdf] about open source software development.

Once I get to Canberra (next week: yikes!) I really need to revise this paper in the light of some of the new literature and the feedback I've gotten from people. I'm presenting it at the [ASA](http://www.asanet.org/convention/2003/) meetings in August, which will give me a push to look at it again. I'm not sure what the right outlet for it is (suggestions are welcome).

One of the good things about this blog being relatively widely-read as these things go is that I've gotten a bunch of great comments on this paper from open-source software developers like Troutgirl, [Ben Hyde](http://enthusiasm.cozy.org/), and others. Their insider perspective on OSS will improve the next draft a great deal, I think.
