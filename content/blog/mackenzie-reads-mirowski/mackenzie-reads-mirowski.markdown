I promised to give this topic up for a bit, but have clearly failed. [Donald MacKenzie](http://www.ed.ac.uk/sociol/Research/Staff/mcknz.htm), the sociologist of technology, has a [draft review essay [pdf]](http://www.ed.ac.uk/sociol/Research/Staff/LRB_Mack.pdf) about Philip Mirowski's *Machine Dreams* on his website. (My own views are [here](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/blog/archives/000045.html#000045)). MacKenzie's take is interesting—- he focuses on the self-fulfilling (or "performative") potential of much economic theory, drawing on [Michel Callon's](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0631206086/) work. MacKenzie suggests that Mirowski's

> abrasive account of the processes forging economic orthodoxy over the past sixty years will annoy his orthodox colleagues, delight economics s dissidents (except the followers of those about whom Mirowski is scathing), educate outsiders whose view of the discipline is often decades out-of-date, and pull the history of economics firmly into the mainstream of the history and social studies of twentieth-century science.

Interestingly (for me), MacKenzie builds to the argument that both self-interest and altruism can't be understood outside their institutional contexts:

> If egoism and generosity are context-sensitive, we need, when making economic and social policy, to consider its effects on them … *Homo oeconomicus*, however, is only one way of being human in general, a way that is to be discouraged. Unfortunately, his inverted twin, norm-governed *homo sociologicus*, is equally a construction. Cooperation, generosity, dedication, trust, a sense of service, orientation to work's intrinsic satisfactions rather than to its extrinsic monetary rewards—- such things need [to be] fostered in how institutions are designed, rather than marginalized or taken for granted. (17-19).

This is essentially the argument I make about altruism in [my paper on blood donation in the E.U.](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/files/papers/embed-alt.pdf), and also in [a paper about organ procurement](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/files/drafts/opo-procrate.pdf) that I'm just about to send out for review.
