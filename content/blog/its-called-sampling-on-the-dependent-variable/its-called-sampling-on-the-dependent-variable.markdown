"Why are there so many personally obnoxious people on the Left?" [asks Nick Denton](http://www.nickdenton.org/archives/005306.html#005306). In his next sentence, he explains to himself why his question is mistaken. ("I happen to spend most of my time in cities which tilt Left â€¦ so the obnoxious people I meet are statistically more likely to be left-wing.") But he presses on regardless to the inevitable single data point. A couple of months ago, using the same methodology, Dan Drezner wondered why people on the left were more sensitive to insults than those on the right. So with [that data](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000214.html "Kieran Healy's Weblog: Empty Questions") in mind, we can now conclude that left-wingers are both more sensitive *and* more obnoxious than right-wingers.

Coming up soon, a study that attempts to explain why so many of the closets I open are full of my clothes.
