The CIA believes North Korea has a ballistic missile [capable of hitting the West Coast](http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/east/02/12/us.nkorea/index.html "CNN.com - Tenet: North Korea has ballistic missile capable of hitting U.S. - Feb. 12, 2003") of the United States. Stay tuned for analysis and comment showing this further proves that Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein are in an unholy alliance together and that an attack on Iraq is therefore fully justifed as a top priority.

I'm hoping Tucson is still just out of range.
