Many forms of education run on a simple principle: if you get good applicants and train them in a straightforward fashion, you will get good results. In higher education, you start with freshmen. Then you flatten them (Econ 101) or mash them (Organic Chem). Add literature requirements or a foreign language. If you want a light taste, add a Phys Ed requirement, study abroad, or art appreciation.

That brings me to my theory of price-quality correlation in higher education. Everything I described is really simple to do and uses very common ingredients, even if it is a bit time intensive. It can also be made in large batches, so it should be cheap to make. And it*is* cheap in places where people actually care about decent training. That's where you get the killer small college with excellent course modules for $150 a credit-hour. [Saint Paul College](http://www.saintpaul.edu)in Minnesota has cheap, but good, courses in this range. [Hesston](http://www.hesston.edu/), a Mennonite place, has decent low cost fare. [Mayland CC is our best example](http://www.mayland.edu/).

So how can you charge $30,000 or $40,000 bucks per year for full service that's nothing other than slow-cooked students with gowns? I don't know, but I suspect the $8,000 course at the local private school with a John Harvard statue is charging for "atmosphere." They are also doing a lot of extra prep â€” weird Red faculty, drowning stuff in melted Zizek, etc. Thus, the typical private school in this range is bad.

Oddly, education gets a whole lot better once you hit the $80,000-$100,000 range. Why? Well, because frankly it's in my interest to claim it does. But at this point, you hit a price point indicating much higher quality ingredients. I mean students. For example, you might get a place with an actual French intellectual, who speaks French and everything. Or you might get a building that's [really as old as it looks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Quad). The [knock-off](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Tower) [faux gothic place](http://www.duke.edu) isn't going to be chasing students in this price range because they know they can't fake it.
