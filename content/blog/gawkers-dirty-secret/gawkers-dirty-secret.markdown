Poor old [Nick Denton](http://www.nickdenton.org). He has his [finger on the pulse](http://www.gawker.com) of Manhattan (although, only the other day we found him [a little behind the curve](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/blog/archives/000240.html#000240) on hot conversation topics). And yet he he discovers that he can be seen eating lunch in the background of a [segment on the Food Network](http://www.nickdenton.org/archives/003432.html#003432 "nickdenton.org: Food Network"), of all places. The shame of it! Even worse, he finds that loads of people have seen it and written to him about it:

> One thing I don't get: who are all these people who watch the Food Network? They should realize that it's far less embarrassing to be caught by the Food Network, than to confess to *watching* the channel.

Actually, Nick knows who all those people are. They're his audience. The ones who read [Gawker](http://www.gawker.com) and his excellent [weblog](http://www.nickdenton.org). Except they're *supposed* to be planning their own kidnappings, crashing [birthday parties](http://www.gawker.com/03/01/003385.html) for hot models, and organizing [threesomes with 'dirtysomethings'](http://www.gawker.com/03/01/003246.html). Instead, they seem to be at home with their cat and a carton of takeout Moo Shu Vegetables, watching [Emeril](http://www.emerils.com/emerilshome.html) pour too much Parmesan cheese on something. Bam! How embarrassing.
