Everyone else is having an end-of-year quiz, so here is mine.

1. About what percentage of the U.S. population use the Internet?

2. About how wide is the gap in usage rates between whites and blacks?

3. Say which of the following is the best predictor of Internet use: Income, Education, Urban residence, Region.

Now scoot over to my good friend [Eszter Hargittai](http://campuscgi.princeton.edu/~eszter/weblog/)'s weblog to see the [answers](http://www.princeton.edu/~eszter/netuse.html). While you're there, read some of her [papers](http://www.princeton.edu/~eszter/research.html).

And here's a note from [Elegant Hack](http://www.eleganthack.com/archives/003152.html#003152 "Blog Entry ") about a related essay by [Meg Hourihan](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2002/12/19/megnut.html). Something to bear in mind the next time someone says "But *no-one* uses dialup anymore."
