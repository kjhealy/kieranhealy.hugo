Later this afternoon, I'll be heading off to join the [Social and Political Theory Program](http://socpol.anu.edu.au/) at the Australian National University's [Research School of Social Sciences](http://rsss.anu.edu.au/), where I'll be spending most of the next year. I probably won't be posting much for the next few days while I find my way to Canberra. On the other hand, I'llb be sitting around in airports a lot, and might not be able to resist the lure of wireless access if it exists.
