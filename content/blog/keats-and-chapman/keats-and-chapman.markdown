David Adesnik at [OxBlog](http://oxblog.blogspot.com/ "OxBlog") gives us Webster's definition of a "canard"—- he argues that "the belief that war will destabilize the Middle East [is] a canard." This reminds me of a sublimely awful mixed metaphor thrown out by historian [Mark Kishlansky](http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~history/faculty/profiles/kishlansky.htm) in his *A Monarchy Transformed: Britain 1603-1714*. Writing about the charlatan [Titus Oates](http://www.lawsch.uga.edu/~glorious/titus_oates.html) he says "He testified to meetings that never took place between people who couldn't have been there, and he was eventually hoist on his own canard."

Natural opportunities to use a line like that don't come along very often. I bet he'd been saving it up for *years*.

Here's another example of the form. It's going to take a whole paragraph to wind up to. In Dublin of the 1930s and after, the two main theaters were [the Gate](http://www.gate-theatre.ie/) and [the Abbey](http://www.abbeytheatre.ie/). The Gate was founded by Hilton Edwards and Michael MacLiammoir, one of Ireland's few publicly gay couples of the time. It was known for bringing modern drama—- Chekov, Ibsen, and so on—- to the Irish stage. The Abbey was founded by W.B. Yeats and Lady Gregory as part of the Anglo-Irish revival. It had more of an Irish flavor, producing Yeats' own plays and Sean O'Casey's *The Plough and the Stars*. When asked for local opinion about the two companies, a local genius said "you could think of them as being like Sodom and Begorrah."

It might be that Irish people have a particular weakness—- I mean, gift—- for this kind of thing. The zenith of the art can be found in the Keats and Chapman vignettes of [Flann O'Brien](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=1564782158), where a shaggy-dog story resolves itself into an [appalling pun](http://radio.weblogs.com/0100191/2002/06/20.html#a179).

None of which has anything to do with the Middle East, but I've started my Thanksgiving holiday early.
