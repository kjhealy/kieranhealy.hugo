Here is something I think about around this time each year. [Newgrange](http://www.knowth.com/newgrange.htm "Newgrange Megalithic Passage Tomb - Ireland") is a megalithic tomb in County Meath's Boyne Valley, in Ireland. It is more than five thousand years old. It was built around 3200BC. It is five hundred years older than the [Great Pyramid of Giza](http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/pyramid.html) and about a thousand years older than [Stonehenge](http://www.christiaan.com/stonehenge/info/students/period_iii/). When it was rediscovered in 1699, it looked like an ordinary hill. It was properly excavated beginning in 1962, when archaeologists thought it was a particularly fine example of a passage grave, but nothing more. Then Prof. M.J. O'Kelly of [U.C.C.](http://www.ucc.ie) discovered the [roof box](http://www.knowth.com/images-ng/ng-roofbox-700.jpg), a small opening in the hill above the passage entrance, which led to a shaft that ran to the chamber at the center of the tomb. On the morning of December 21st 1967, O'Kelly sat in the central chamber and, as the sun came up, saw [the first rays of the rising sun](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/blog/archives/newgrange.html) run down the shaft and strike the floor of the chamber.

Newgrange is a clock. The shaft leading out to the roof box is precisely aligned so that on the morning of the Winter Solstice the first light of day will run directly into the middle of the tomb. Or, at least, it *was* precisely so aligned. A few years ago, it was calculated that changes in the Earth's orbit had affected where the first light now strikes. When it was built, the sun would have struck the back wall of the chamber, rather than the floor, and the light would have remained in the chamber for about four minutes longer than it does now. It was very accurate. The people who built Newgrange knew what they were doing.

A society—- a civilization, if you like—- is a hard thing to hold together. If you live in an agrarian society, as the overwhelming majority of people did until about two hundred years ago, few times are harder than the dead of Winter. The days are at their shortest, the sun is far away, and the [Malthusian edge](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/archives/001260.html), in Brad DeLong's phrase, is right in front of you. Is it any wonder why so many religious festivals take place around the solstice? And yet here were a people, more than five millennia ago, able not only to pull through the Winter successfully, but able also to build a huge timepiece to remind themselves that they were going to make it.

It's a remarkable thing.
