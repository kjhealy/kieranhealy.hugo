Oh the Feminists hate Republicans
 And Republicans hate the Feminists
 To mock all Feminazis
 Is an old G.O.P. rule

But during [Islamo-Fascism Week](http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&q=islamo-fascism+week)
 Islamo-Fascism Week
 You'll see Ann Coulter On Our Backs at USC
 She's helping Muslims seek
 Their Feminine Mystique
 Simone De Beauvoir's really very cool

Oh FrontPage hates the atheists
 The liberals and the Darwinists
 The godless and the secular
 In the groves of Academe

But during Islamo-Fascism Week
 Islamo-Fascism Week
 *The Origin of Species* is beyond critique
 Mr Horowitz, he has a plan
 To carpet-bomb Tehran
 With hardback copies of *The Selfish Gene*

Oh Conservatives hate the sodomites
 And the lesbians and degenerates
 Repressing deviant urges
 Is a vital party test

But during Islamo-Fascism Week
 Islamo-Fascism Week
 See Rick Santorum weep for every closeted Sheikh
 Defend the freedom of the West
 And the freaks who represent it best
 It's only for a week so have no fear
 Be grateful that it doesn't last all year!
