I go away for the weekend and return to find war-talk in the blog world has ratcheted up another couple of notches. [MaxSpeak](http://maxspeak.org/gm/archives/00000548.html) goes up against [The Volokh Conspiracy](http://volokh.blogspot.com/2002_09_29_volokh_archive.html). Max comes out ahead. Also some good stuff from him on the recent [demonstrations in D.C.](http://maxspeak.org/gm/archives/00000542.html). Meanwhile, [Mark Kleiman](http://markarkleiman.blogspot.com/) links to the [NYT Op-Ad](http://mkpolitics.blogspot.com/2002_09_29_mkpolitics_archive.html#85505412) by thirty-three scholars in international relations who think war with Iraq is a bad idea. Note to self: If [Thomas Schelling](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674840313/) is telling you that your next move is a bad one, you should be paying attention.
