[Ted Barlow](http://tedbarlow.blogspot.com/2003_01_19_tedbarlow_archive.html#87904254 "tedbarlow") is appalled by the gap in median net worth between whites ($120,900) and blacks ($17,000), and asks "Can that be right?"

Yes it can. Ted's discovered the difference between income-based and wealth-based measures of inequality. A good place to get oriented on the black-white wealth gap is Dalton Conley's book, [Being Black, Living in the Red](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0520216733). Scroll down [this page](http://home.nyu.edu/~dc66/honky_frmset.html) on Dalton's website for reviews of the book. Two other good overviews of wealth inequalities in the U.S. are Lisa Keister's [Wealth in America](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0521627516) and Wolff and Leone's [Top Heavy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1565846656) (2nd ed.).
