Everyone else is talking about health care this week, so here's a reprise of an old post of mine. Below is a figure showing the relationship between the "Publicness" of the health system and the amount spent on health care per person per year. Data points are each country's mean score on these measures for the years 1990 to 2001.

![image](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/health-ratios-2.png) You can also get a [nicer PDF version](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/health-ratios.pdf) of this figure. As you can see, health care in other advanced capitalist democracies is typically twice as public and half as expensive as the United States.

When I posted this before, I made the mistake of not emphasizing a key point: these data **do not include** any health-related Research and Development spending, so it's not the case that the U.S. is way up in the top left simply because it's generously subsidizing everyone else's research costs.

The figure doesn't show it, but it's worth noting that despite not having a national health system, U.S. public expenditure on health in the 1990s was *higher* in terms of GDP than in Ireland, Switzerland, Spain, Austria, Japan, Australia and Britain.

It's easy to see that mainstream debate about health care in the U.S. happens inside a self-contained bubble, and that one of its main conservative tropes—the inevitable expense and inefficiency of some kind of universal health care system—is wholly divorced from the data.
