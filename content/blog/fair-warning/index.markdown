When I am President, those people who think they are so *clever* and such *savvy travelers* for using the parents' room instead of the regular bathroom—because it's quieter and cleaner and they read about this handy trick in a "Travel Tips" column once, even though they do not have, say, an unhappy five-month-old in their arms who needs a change and a feed—had better watch out. I will have the [Justice Department](http://www.discourse.net/archives/2004/06/olcs_aug_1_2002_torture_memo_the_bybee_memo.html) and a team of [Military Lawyers](http://billmon.org/archives/001518.html) by my side, together with a bag of bamboo splinters, a [Leatherman Crunch](http://www.leatherman.com/products/tools/crunch/default.asp), a [Camping Stove](http://www.gearreview.com/stovereview98.asp#CGTristar) and a copy of the [Constitution of the United States](http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html) for kindling. And who would stop me? For one thing, a War on Irritating Frequent Flyers would command widespread popular support, and I would be willing to consider opening New Fronts in this war, e.g., on People Who Cut Me Off In Traffic, or Bloggers Who Do Not Link To My Posts. Besides, in [the words of President George W. Bush](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/11/17/60minutes/main529657.shtml), "I am the commander, see? I do not need to explain why I say things. — That's the interesting thing about being the President. — Maybe somebody needs to explain to me why they say something, but I don't feel like I owe anybody an explanation."[1]

fn1. Previously thought to be mere managerial bravado but subsequently discovered by Administration lawyers to be a valid constitutional argument licensing the use of torture against unspecified numbers of persons.
