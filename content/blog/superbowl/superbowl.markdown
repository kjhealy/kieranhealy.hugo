1.  I hope next year Burger King Corporation just make a pile of 2 million dollar bills and set it on fire, rather than taking the roundabout method of pointlessly wasting money they opted for this year.
2.  I am at a loss to understand commercials like the Diet Pepsi one, where the can of Pepsi gets a record contract from P. Diddy, etc, etc. How do those even make it out of a creative's sketchbook?
3.  If the denial of the Seahawks' first quarter touchdown was the correct call *and* the awarding of the Steelers' first quarter touchdown was the correct call, then we're obviously living in a world where I'm going to win the Nobel Prize for Physics next year. I'll start writing my speech.
