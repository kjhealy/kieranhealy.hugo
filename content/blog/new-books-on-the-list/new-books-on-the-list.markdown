A new batch of books for the Reading List to the right. San Francisco has some very good bookstores, by the way.

Let me sing the praises again of [MTAmazon](http://mtamazon.sourceforge.net/), the Movable Type plugin that makes it trivial to switch out the books on the list. It's great. And if you buy one of these books through its link here, I think I get a cut or something. (Let me know if that's workingâ€¦)
