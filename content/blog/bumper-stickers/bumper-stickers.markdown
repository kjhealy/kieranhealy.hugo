David Bernstein at Volokh posts about his favorite [bumper stickers](http://volokh.com/2003_10_19_volokh_archive.html#106660122225674989). The central mystery about bumper stickers in the U.S., by the way, is why they are called "bumper stickers" in the first place seeing as Americans call bumpers "fenders." But I digress.

David's favorite stickers are determined wholly by his politics. One of his "all-time favorites" is "If you can't read this, thank the public schools," which doesn't seem that interesting to me. (Its counterpart, "If you can read this, thank a teacher," isn't much good either.) His least favorite ones endorse lefty sentiments that he has no time for. Two of my favorite stickers comment on religious matters, though they endorse differing world views. The first is "In case of Rapture, this vehicle will be empty." The second, which I've only seen once (on a car in New Jersey), is "Jesus loves you, but everyone else thinks you're an asshole."
