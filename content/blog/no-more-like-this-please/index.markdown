The roles of three Professors in the blogsphere crystallize: [Mark Kleiman](http://markarkleiman.blogspot.com/2002_10_01_markarkleiman_archive.html#85562471) makes the sharp observation that liberals are better than conservatives about standing up for the free expression of those with whom they disagree. [Eugene Volokh](http://volokh.blogspot.com/2002_10_13_volokh_archive.html#85561603) writes a thoughtful response from the conservative point of view. And [Glenn Reynolds](http://www.instapundit.com/archives/004698.php "Instapundit.com:") helpfully, if unwittingly, serves as a data point.

Here's the [original story](http://www.news.scotsman.com/education.cfm?id=1129532002). Honestly, the image of the cow-suited protestor drowned in milk is funny—- but the reaction from Reynolds is lame. "More like this please", indeed. Same goes for [Iain Murray](http://englandssword.blogspot.com/), who provided the original link and "chortles" that "the coming generation… sees through idiotarianism." Yeah, that's what we need: more groups of teenagers roaming about assaulting people whom they find ridiculous. We'd all be safer.

[Ted Barlow](http://tedbarlow.blogspot.com/2002_10_13_tedbarlow_archive.html#83032379) has a good response. Incidentally, I don't feel the need to ritualistically say "Of course I disagree with PETA." Just on the basis of historical trends, if you want to predict something that will be thought of as barbaric a few generations down the line—- in much the same way as we think of, say, [killing cats for fun](http://www.historyuniverse.com/bookstore2/0465015565AMUS132679.shtml) as barbaric now, then the [industrialized meat production techniques](http://www.vegsoc.org/info/laying.html) of modern agribusiness would be as good a bet as any.
