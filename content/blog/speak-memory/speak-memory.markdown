[Kevin Drum](http://calpundit.blogspot.com/2003_02_16_calpundit_archive.html#89259097 "CalPundit") talks about research on memory and memory distortion by [Elizabeth Loftus](http://www.seweb.uci.edu/faculty/loftus/). She looks at how [false memories can be created](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/orange/la-me-memory17feb17,1,3531057.story?coll=la-editions-orange) with a bit of suggestion.

My good friend [Mara Mather](http://people.ucsc.edu/~mather/) at U.C. Santa Cruz also studies memory distortion. [Her work](http://people.ucsc.edu/~mather/researchsummary.html) is interesting because it focuses on how people remember the details of their own choices and decisions. She suggests that there's a tradeoff between accurate remembering and current well-being. We'd regret things a lot more if we had the benefit of hindsight *and* could remember all the details of the better choice we might have made. Some of her [papers](http://people.ucsc.edu/~mather/publications.html) are online and are well worth reading. I was a research subject in the one on [Misrememberance of Options Past](http://people.ucsc.edu/~mather/pdffiles/Matheretal2000.pdf). As far as I recall, anyway.
