Over dinner with my [vegan wife](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul), conversation turned to [GMOs](http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring01/Denlinger/plain.html). (After close observation over a period of years, I can say the benefits of being vegan are manifold. The main downside seems to be endless conversations about it with defensive and/or offensive carnivores. The carnivores always start these conversations.) I started thinking about hypothetical GMOs that would do well on the Irish food market and came up with the **Pigtato**. Main benefits: (1) Contains most of the ingredients for a full Irish breakfast. (2) Integrates the starch food group into the pig family, thereby creating a major competitor to soybeans as nature's most versatile food. (3) Digs itself up.

Other suggestions for potential GMOs are welcome.
