As you've probably seen on the news, Mark Kleiman's blog [has moved](http://www.markarkleiman.com). Update your blogroll.

It just struck me that if all your information about America came from political blogs, you'd think the country was composed mainly of libertarians together with a bloc of right-wing populist-imperialists and a few liberals here and there. But if all your information about *California* came from political blogs, you'd think the state's politics must be a model of thoughtful [right-](http://www.volokh.com) and [left-](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable-type)leaning commentary, marked by a care for [civility](http://www.markarkleiman.com), a tendency to [moderation](http://www.calpundit.com) and a close attention to detail.

Just goes to show.
