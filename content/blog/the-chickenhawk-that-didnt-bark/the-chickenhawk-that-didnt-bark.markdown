[Matthew Yglesias](http://www.matthewyglesias.com/ "Matthew Yglesias") (for the second time) does sterling service in reminding the world that people like [Christopher Hitchens](http://slate.msn.com/?id=2073772) are busily attacking a version of the Chickenhawk argument that is being aggressively propagated by, um, nobody. [Eugene Volokh](http://volokh.blogspot.com/2002_11_10_volokh_archive.html#85664691) endorses Hitchens, so it's probably only a matter of time before it moves along the blogger food chain (up? down?) to [Instapundit](http://www.instapundit.com) and becomes established as a Conservative Talking Point: "Anti-war bloggers challenge principle of civil authority over the military! Believe only Soldiers should make Military Policy! Believe only Cows should make Agricultural Policy! Idiots!"

Matthew makes the proper CH argument in about three sentences. I have yet to see it rebutted. Jett at Stand Down [posts about it too](http://www.nowarblog.org/archives/000172.html#000172), though not as forcefully.
