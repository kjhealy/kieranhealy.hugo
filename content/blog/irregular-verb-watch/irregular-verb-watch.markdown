This [New York Times Report](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/05/nyregion/05FIRE.html) about a fight in a firehouse defines a new [irregular verb](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/000536.html) in its first three sentences. The conjugation appears to be "I tease playfully; You make abusive taunts; He is asking for a broken nose." (Via [En Banc](http://www.enbanc.org/archives/000494.html).)
