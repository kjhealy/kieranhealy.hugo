Speaking of [accepting responsibility](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/002176.html), I am planning to take the credit for [this trend](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/kieran.png) (also [pdf](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/kieran.pdf), to print out and hang on your wall). Go to the [Social Security Administration Website](http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/) and investigate some trends for yourself. See the decline of the Heathers, the sudden, spectactular rise of the Ellas, and the terrible Hillary crash of 1993. Then read Stanley Lieberson's [A Matter of Taste](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300083858/kieranhealysw-20/ref=nosim/) for the sociology.
