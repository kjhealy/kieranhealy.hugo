David Goldenberg at [Gelf Magazine](http://www.gelfmagazine.com) has a copy of [the survey](http://www.gelfmagazine.com/gelflog/archives/media.html#surveying_ivy_league_motherhood) that Louise Story conducted as the basis for her [irritating](http://crookedtimber.org/2005/09/20/mommy-tracking-the-ivy-leaguers/) [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/20/national/20women.html?ei=5090&en=6a8e0c413c09c249&ex=1284868800&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all) about Ivy League women and their plans for motherhood. Doing a reliable survey is hard, and by far the two biggest difficulties are sample selectivity (when the probability of participation is related to the outcome you want to measure: this a very tricky problem) and poor design of questions (where you look for what you want to find). Here are the first few questions from the survey, which was emailed to a group of freshman and senior women at Yale:

> When you have children, do you plan to stay at home with them or do you plan to continue working? Why?
>
> If you plan to continue working, do you plan to work full-time in an office, or full-time from your house, or part-time in an office, or part-time from your house? Why?â¨â¨If you plan to stay at home with your kids, do you plan to return to work? If so, how old will you wait for your kids to be when you return?
>
> Was your mom a stay-at-home mom? Explain whether she worked, and how much she worked! Were you glad with her choice (to either work or stay-at-home or whatever combination she did)?â¨â¨At what age do you think youâll have kids? How many kids do you want?
