Here are two small sites I made recently, and which I may continue to tweak and expand. The first, [`plain-text.co`](http://plain-text.co), presents "The Plain Person's Guide to Plain-Text Social Science". It is designed to address some questions about managing research and writing projects in the social sciences using plain-text and free or mostly-free tools like Emacs (or other text editors), R, `pandoc`, and `make`. The second, [`vissoc.co`](http://vissoc.co) which I've mentioned before, compiles notes from a [short course in data visualization](http://vissoc.co) I taught last semester. In both cases, the source files behind the sites are available on [github](http://github.com/kjhealy), along with various templates, examples, and configuration files (more about those [here](https://kieranhealy.org/resources)) meant to make your plain-text coding and writing life a little easier.
