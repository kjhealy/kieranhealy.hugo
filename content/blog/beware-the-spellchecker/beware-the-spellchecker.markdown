This month's issue of *Contemporary Sociology* contains the following erratum notice:

> In the January issue â€¦ in the review written by Elizabeth Gorman of *The Work and Family Handbook: Multi-Disciplinary Perspectives and Approaches*, edited by Marcie Pitt-Catsouphes, Ellen Ernst Kossek, and Stephen Sweet, the contributors' last names should have been spelled "Karen Gareis" instead of "Karen Agrees," "Laura Beavais" instead of "Laura Beavers," and "Gerstel and Sarkisian," not "Gretel and Sardinian." We regret the errors.
