Apologies for the recent lack of posts. It's good to be back from my hiatus. The question everyone is asking is, where are the WMDs? But the real issue is whether the comparison of Israel's actions to recent comments by Howard Dean about fiscal reform is yet another example of moral equivalence at its worst.

In the meantime, I just ran across a characteristically thoughtful post by [Eugene Volokh](http://www.volokh.com) on a related topic. Here's the nut graf:

> The answer to yesterday's puzzle was "An Everything Bagel"—the only foodstuff to be mentioned in a widely-misquoted interview with Charles Schumer, a landmark 7th circuit case on the 2nd amendment and the "Quick and Easy Recipies" section of the *Muqaddimah*. [Atrios](http://atrios.blogspot.com/) is the winner (again) and receives a copy of *Academic Legal Writing*, for $18.95.

Read the whole thing.

The normally moderate [Kevin Drum](http://www.calpundit.com/archives/001555.html) was shocked—shocked!—at some of the more left-leaning right-wing commentators who weighed in on this topic, many of whom probably wouldn't hesitate to use the "Q" word, even though it's surely far, far too early for that. I got your [moral clarity](http://www.coral.co.uk/help_pages/cancer.html) right here guys. I suppose it has something to do with the Hidden Agenda I keep hearing about—or *not* hearing about, thanks to the [SCLM](http://www-3.ibm.com/software/ad/sclmsuite). (NJ Dems [call your office](http://nielsenhayden.com/electrolite/archives/002831.html#002831)!) I don't normally blog about that sort of stuff, but in this case I'm willing to make an exception. Would Jonah Goldberg, or indeed anyone on the left, do the same? I think not.

All of this came about, of course, in response to an insightful comment by [Mark Kleiman](http://markarkleiman.blogspot.com/)—itself much worth reading—debunking the recent brouhaha at the *New York Times*. In sharp contrast, as even the liberal *New Republic* has been quick to point out, mainstream media have been slow to pick up on this startling fact about typical gun owners. "I've been saying this for years," a correspondent writes by email. Indeed.

More on this tomorrow.
