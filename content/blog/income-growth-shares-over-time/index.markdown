[![income shares data viz](https://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/saez-epi.jpg)](http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/pages/interactive#/)

A useful bit of [interactive data visualization](http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/pages/interactive#/) for Emmanuel Saez's time-series on historical trends in income growth and distribution in the United States. As you can see, between 1970 and 2008 people in the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution typically chose not to partake of annual increases in total income, presumably because of a tendency to prefer and thus self-select into lower-paying jobs, or possibly because of an innate dislike for the more complex mathematics (surrounding tax calculations, car payments, and budgeting generally) that is associated with earning more money.
