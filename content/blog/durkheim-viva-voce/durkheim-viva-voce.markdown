I just attended the American Sociological Association Meetings in San Francisco, and while there my friend [Marion Fourcade](http://marionfourcade.org) told me about a remarkable little piece of sociological history. It's an audio recording of Émile Durkheim delivering a talk.

I had no idea such a thing existed. The recording is about two and a half minutes long. It's a fragment of a piece titled *Jugements de valeur et jugements de réalité*, which you can [read in French here](https://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/durkheim-jugements-text.pdf). It was recorded in 1911 at a meeting in Bologna, which I think is one of only quite few times that Durkheim left France in order to attend a conference. Here it is. (There's a short bit of dead silence at the beginning.)

(If you don't see the player, [download the clip directly](https://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/durkheim-jugements-de-valeur-1911.mp3)).

The original is held at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. Here's the [catalog entry for the recording](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k127959h.r=durkheim.langEN). I think what's needed to top this is maybe some decent video footage of Marx's speech on the anniversary of the people's paper.
