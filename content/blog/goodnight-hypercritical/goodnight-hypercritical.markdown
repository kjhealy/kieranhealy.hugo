<blockquote>In the great Mac Pro<br /> 
there were Channels of Control<br />
and a Naked Robotic Core<br />
and a picture of ...<br />
Just a Dinosaur<br />
And there was the Tortise and Hare, and Invisible Software
<br />
<br />
And Grandpa Uncle Joe who Ran Out of Bombs Long Ago<br />
And Patent Hands, and an iLife island
<br />
<br />
And Blue Ocean, a Wedge, and Objective-C<br />
And all the Housewives of Siracusa County
<br />
<br />
Goodnight Pro Mac, Goodnight Brute Force Attack<br />
Goodnight Tortise and Hare, and Invisible Software
<br />
<br />
Goodnight White Smoke, and Paths in the Grass<br />
Goodnight Cautionary Tale, Goodnight Thundercats
<br />
<br />
Goodnight Grandpa Joe, Goodnight Bombs Long Ago<br />
Goodnight Next Big Move, Goodnight room to improve
<br />
<br />
Goodnight Patent Hands, Goodnight iLife island<br />
Goodnight Dark Age of Objective-C, Goodnight You Will Die Instantly
<br />
<br />
Goodnight Memory Palace, Goodnight 5by5<br />
Goodnight nobody, Goodnight Fusion Drive 
<br />
<br />
And Goodnight Siracusa County Housewives
<br />
<br />
Goodnight podcast, Goodnight Talking to the Bear
<br />
<br />
Goodnight Jackals, everywhere</blockquote>
