New York's Open Data initiative continues to provide a lot of really excellent material to experiment with visually. Here is a map of building footprints in Manhattan, with their roof heights designated by color. Made with `R` and `ggplot` along with the `sf` package. The PNG is relatively high-resolution so you should be able to zoom in a bit to see some familiar outlines.
