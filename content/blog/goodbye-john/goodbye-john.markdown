My friend [John Pollock](http://philosophy.arizona.edu/people/view/?id=134) died yesterday. I'll leave it to [others](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2009/09/in-memoriam-john-l-pollock-19402009.html) to write up his many contributions to philosophy and computer science. I wanted to take a moment to remember him as the hard-charging mountain biker he was. He introduced me to biking shortly after I moved to Tucson, and he spent a lot of time driving me and many others all over Southern Arizona to ride on desert singletrack. Despite being almost twice my age he (and several others even older) would routinely leave me behind on the trail, cranking up hills or blasting down them. Eventually I started to be able to keep up better, but that was partly because John sold me his beautiful [Ellsworth](http://www.ellsworthbikes.com/) Truth, pictured above, at a knock-down price. It's a great bike. Too good for me, really. I'll miss you, John.
