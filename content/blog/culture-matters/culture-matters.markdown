There's often a strong temptation to think that only other people have culture, a mistake of the same kind as thinking only other people speak with an accent. The odd beliefs and attitudes of foreigners are best explained by reference to their culture, whereas our own actions are generally rational and defensible on their own terms. [This fascinating story](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/23/international/asia/23JAPA.html) is about the Japanese hostages recently released in Iraq and their subsequent reception on their return home. It's a reminder that culture matters and an invitation to the comparative sociology of culture. Thanks to my friend [Marion Fourcade-Gourinchas](http://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/fourcade-gourinchas/) for the pointer. Incidentally, you really should read Marion's terrific article on [Politics, Institutional Structures and the Rise of Economics](http://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/fourcade-gourinchas/T&SFinal.pdf).
