Just [listen to at least the first few minutes of this radio show](http://www.wnyc.org/stream/ram?file=/radiolab/radiolab042106a.mp3) , which begins with the work of [Diana Deustch](http://psy.ucsd.edu/~ddeutsch/), a psychologist who studies the psychology of music. The opening segment demonstrates a remarkable phenomenon, whereby a looped segment of ordinary speech appears—after a few repetitions—to become musical. Moreover, once you've perceived it as music, listening to the segment in context makes it sound like the speaker is in a Busby Berkeley musical and has just begun to segue into a solo number. The general musicality of speech is obvious, I suppose, especially when you listen to certain accents, or hear [uptalk](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002967.html). But this is a very nice sort of case.
