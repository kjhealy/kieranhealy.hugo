From Chapter 3 of Tacitus's [*Annals*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140440607/kieranhealysw-20/ref=nosim/):

> In the same year, there was a religious innovation: a new Brotherhood of Augustus was created, on the analogy of the ancient Titian Brotherhood founded by King Titus Tatius for the maintenance of the Sabine ritual. Twenty-one members were appointed by lot from the leading men of the State; and Tiberius, Drusus, Claudius, and Germanicus were added. The annual Games established in honour of Augustus were also begun. But their inauguration was troubled by disorders due to rivalry between ballet-dancers.

Factotum: Caesar, the ballet dancers are rioting!
 Tiberius: Oh, not again.
