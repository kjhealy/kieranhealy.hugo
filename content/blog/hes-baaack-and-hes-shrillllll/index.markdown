[Tom Friedman returns](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/03/opinion/03friedman.html?oref=login) in his new guise as Chief Assistant to the Assistant Chief Sassanian Senmurv's Sub-Deaconry Baldachin Polisher in the Noble, Ancient and Hermetic Order of the Shrill:

> Sorry, I've been away writing a book. I'm back, so let's get right down to business: We're in trouble in Iraq. I don't know what is salvageable there anymore. ... This war has been hugely mismanaged by this administration, in the face of clear advice to the contrary at every stage, and as a result the range of decent outcomes in Iraq has been narrowed and the tools we have to bring even those about are more limited than ever. ... For all of President Bush's vaunted talk about being consistent and resolute, the fact is he never established U.S. authority in Iraq. Never. This has been the source of all our troubles. We have never controlled all the borders, we have never even consistently controlled the road from Baghdad airport into town, because we never had enough troops to do it. ... Because each time the Bush team had to choose between doing the right thing in the war on terrorism or siding with its political base and ideology, it chose its base and ideology. More troops or radically lower taxes? Lower taxes. Fire an evangelical Christian U.S. general who smears Islam in a speech while wearing the uniform of the U.S. Army or not fire him so as not to anger the Christian right? Don't fire him. Apologize to the U.N. for not finding the W.M.D., and then make the case for why our allies should still join us in Iraq to establish a decent government there? Don't apologize – for anything – because Karl Rove says the "base" won't like it. Impose a "Patriot Tax" of 50 cents a gallon on gasoline to help pay for the war, shrink the deficit and reduce the amount of oil we consume so we send less money to Saudi Arabia? Never. Just tell Americans to go on guzzling. Fire the secretary of defense for the abuses at Abu Ghraib, to show the world how seriously we take this outrage – or do nothing? Do nothing. Firing Mr. Rumsfeld might upset conservatives. Listen to the C.I.A.? Only when it can confirm your ideology. When it disagrees – impugn it or ignore it.

Whew! This seems a long way from Did ole [Airmiles](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/001614.html) finally run into [Daniel](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/001153.html) in a 1st Class Transit Lounge somewhere? Perhaps Tom is realizing that, thanks to the Bush Administration, he may get the [twenty year occupation](http://bodyandsoul.blogspot.com/2003_02_01_bodyandsoul_archive.html#88706640) he told *Oprah* viewers to gear up for last year.
