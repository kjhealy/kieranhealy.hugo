Here's a figure showing the relationship between the median diameter of street-trees (i.e., trees not in parks) and median household income for New York City neighborhoods at the NTA level. I've broken out the graph by borough. The relationship is strongest in the Bronx; in Manhattan you have rich tree-lined UES and UWS neighborhoods, but also wealthy mid- and lower-Manhattan neighborhoods where planting isnâ€™t possible.

The figure is also available [as a PDF file](tree_diameter_by_income_faceted.pdf).

New York's [Open Data program](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us) makes a lot of great material available. The Street Tree survey is one of the most fun to play with. 

Incidentally, Drawing faceted plots of NYC would be a lot more elegant if there were six boroughs instead of five. Please consider splitting Queens in two. Or actually, just eliminate Staten Island.
