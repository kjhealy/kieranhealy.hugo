[Daniel Davies](http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/) is back with three posts in a row. As you probably know, he has a superb line in sheer invective. Here are two choice examples:

> Part of the joy is watching a man who knows nothing about anything except the innards of mobile phones trying to understand a complicated world around him with no sources of information other than the Internet.

> Professor Whatsisface (don't ask me, I get my news from blogs) is just trying to avoid creating the impression that he is stuck in some third-rate job in the academic gulag, sitting around teaching morons in a town where the definition of an intellectual is someone who can keep his mouth shut when he points at aeroplanes.

Head over and soak it up.
