![image](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/blog/images/poetic-headline-cap.gif) I just finished watching Ireland vs Cameroon. (What a second half! We should have won!) Well, not so much watching as endlessly updating a webpage: when you don't have cable and you live in Tucson, live football coverage is hard to come by. I couldn't even listen to a radio broadcast streamed online, because neither RTE nor the BBC have the rights to do this.

Anyway, more important: Immediately after the game I went to [Ireland.com](http://www.ireland.com) for some match reports. I saw the headlines listed to the right and thought that they pretty well summed up the feelings of many Irish peopleâ€”- even if it's the wrong Keane they're talking about.
