Just now—around 9:55pm—Laurie and I were sitting watching a DVD when we both saw a large white ball of light (with a greenish-blue tinge) flash across the sky, burning like mad. It seemed to be heading roughly south to north and had a long tail. I suppose it was a meteor of some variety, but certainly not your common-or-garden shooting star. It was enormous by comparison, even bigger, I think, than a burning airplane would have been, and travelling much, much faster and clearly higher up. I've never seen anything remotely like it. I expect that many people spotted it, doubtless including the folks nearby at [Kitt Peak](http://www.noao.edu/kpno/). I'll be looking out for news reports about what it was, where it was headed and how much of it, if any, made it to the ground.
