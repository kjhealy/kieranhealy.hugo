After a moderately funny NPR April Fool's piece on banning ringtones in New York, [this sponsor announcement](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/NPRSoylentGreen.mp3) made me laugh out loud.

On the news headlines that followed, the lead item was that the U.S. was scrambling to complete a huge free trade deal ("the biggest since NAFTA") with North Korea.
