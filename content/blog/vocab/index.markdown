Waiting for the England vs Trinidad & Tobago match to start (come on the Caribbean!), I came across [this story](http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,19340338-29277,00.html) about a giant ocean vortex spinning off the coast of Australia. The article notes in passing that the vortex is "visible from space." I think this expression needs to be retired. These days, the hosereel in my back yard is visible from space, and conveniently catalogued in an NSA database somewhere. (See: Potential WMD.) While I'm wasting your time, I want to complain about English (and Irish) football supporters who prissily correct Americans for using the word "soccer" and avoid that word themselves. I mean, it's not as if the Americans invented the wordâ€”the Brits did, in the late 19th century, and the modern spelling was standardized around 1910. People used it interchangeably with "football" (and occasionally "Garrison Game") when I was a kid.

OK, the game is starting. I predict Wayne Rooney will come on some time in the second half, and he will be so pumped with weeks of pent-up excitement that he'll charge two-footed into his first tackle, breaking the leg of whoever is on the other end and tearing his own cruciate ligament to ribbons.
