Via [Matt Yglesias](http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/11/i_guess_its_not_gotcha_journal.php), a headline and subhead from a [Newsweek profile](http://www.newsweek.com/id/72121) of Giuliani:

> Growing Up Giuliani: Rudy Giuliani was raised to understand that fine, blurry line between saint and sinner. The making of his moral code.

It seems to me that a line can be fine, or it can be blurry. I'm having a hard time visualizing a fine, blurry line.
