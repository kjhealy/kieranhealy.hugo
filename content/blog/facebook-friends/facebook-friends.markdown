Not one but *two* former office mates of mine are quoted on the front page of the Times today in a [story about Facebook](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/style/17facebook.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin). [Jason Kaufman](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/kaufman/) talks about his work with [Nicholas Christakis](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/christakis/) on patterns of affiliation amongst Facebook users. Our own Eszter Hargittai talks about her research on comparative adoption of Facebook and MySpace. And my brilliant colleague [Ron Breiger](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~breiger/) will doubtless be pleased to see that Georg Simmel gets a shoutout too, for the idea of triadic social closure.
