Go read Jim Henley's [response](http://www.highclearing.com/archivesuo/week_2003_03_23.html#003948 "Unqualified Offerings") to this [inane argument](http://www.aynrand.org/medialink/innocentsinwar2.shtml) from Onkar Ghate. Ghate, an Objectivist writing for the Ayn Rand Institute, thinks "mass civilian casualties in terrorist countries" [sic!] are the fault of said innocent civilians. If nothing else, it's worth seeing how a devoted follower of Ayn Rand manages not only to justify the state-sponsored killing of civilians, but to actually blame the civilians for this. Ayn, you've come a long way, baby.

Individual free-thinking is not well-tolerated by [Randroids](http://www.villainsupply.com/miscevil.html) (ah, the irony), but Jim links to some [Objectivist objections](http://coldfury.com/reason/comments.php?id=P462_0_1_0) (also [here](http://coldfury.com/reason/comments.php?id=P463_0_1_0)) to Ghate by Arthur Silber.
