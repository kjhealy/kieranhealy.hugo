AP reports that the [Ozone hole over Antarctica has shrunk, and split in two](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20020930/ap_wo_en_po/sci_shrinking_ozone_hole_1). Now, it seems OK so say a hole is shrinking. How a hole splits in two is harder for me to see. What exactly is doing the splitting? Or maybe splitting (extra matter coming in one particular way) is just a special case of shrinking (extra matter coming in all around, more or less). But *that* seems weird, because by adding matter you get *more* holes. Questions like this are why I am not a philosopher. I need to go re-read [David and Steffi Lewis's dialog on Holes](http://216.239.51.100/search?q=cache:x959jGhf9-YC:hrp2.student.harvard.edu/1994/94_76.pdf+david+lewis+holes+argle+bargle&hl=en&ie=UTF-8). Or else get [Laurie](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul) to give [Achille Varzi](http://www.columbia.edu/~av72/) a call for me. (You may remember Achille being in the news during the Florida election disaster, when experts on holes—- and what counted as a hole in, say, a punch card—- were in rare but heavy demand.)
