Daniel's post on Crooked Timber about [the Cancun trade talks](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/000520.html) explains that their failure was rooted in disagreement about restrictions on foreign investment and capital controls. This reminds me that it's time you all re-read Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas and Olivier Jeanne's paper "[The Elusive Benefits from International Financial Integration](http://www.princeton.edu/~pog/academic/liberalization/)," which I blogged about [a few months ago](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000446.html).
