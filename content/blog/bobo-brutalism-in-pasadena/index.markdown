I arrived in Pasadena (from Sydney) yesterday. Or possibly today. I'm still adjusting to jetlag, driving on the right and Los Angeles in general. The view of the mountains from the hotel is beautiful, at least in the photo in the hotel guidebook. Right now the smog makes them invisible. The area around the hotel has the usual collection of dull office blocks and carpark-like structures that turn out also to be office blocks. I've seen three buildings so far that are more than three stories tall, face the street on at least two sides, and have no windows at all: a Bank of America, a Target, and a Macy's. I don't have very high expectations when it comes to urban design, but these things look like the *Simpsons*' Springfield Mall. They might as well have "Ministry of Truth" or "Central Reprocessing" written on the side. Is Pasadena particularly bad in this respect? Or has nine months away from the U.S. been enough for me to start paying attention to this kind of thing again?
