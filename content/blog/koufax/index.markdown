Hey, I got nominated in the ["Best Writing"](http://www.pla.blogspot.com/2002_12_15_pla_archive.html#86139565 "P.L.A. - A Journal of Politics, Law and Autism") category of [PLA](http://www.pla.blogspot..com)'s [Koufax Awards](http://www.pla.blogspot.com/2002_12_15_pla_archive.html#86142122). I'm not going to win, but go over there and [vote](http://www.pla.blogspot.com/2002_12_15_pla_archive.html#86139565) for me in the comments section anyway. Thanks to anyone who nominated me.

I think the best thing about this awards idea is that it's pointing me to good stuff I didn't know about before. I now have a list of new blogs to waste time reading. Great!
