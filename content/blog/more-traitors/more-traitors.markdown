Someone should tell [William Sjostrom](http://www.atlanticblog.com/archives/000670.html#000670) that [George H.W. Bush](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-605441,00.html) seems to have joined "Saddam's fifth column."

**Update**: Kevin Drum [adds some context](http://calpundit.blogspot.com/2003_03_09_calpundit_archive.html#90500152) to this story (particularly the information that the Bush Sr speech was given a fortnight ago) which makes it clear that there's more spin than substance to the *Times* of London piece.
