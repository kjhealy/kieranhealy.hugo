It's five o'clock on a Friday, it's the middle of the Summer, I'm wasting my time. I'm looking at my web-server's log files. Any fantasies I have about this site being widely read are crushed by the data they contain. This page comes to you courtesy of **fiachra**, my office workstation. Fiachra also contains other bits of my web-presence, most importantly a little [file tree](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/files) where I put pdfs of published and draft papers, teaching materials and other odds and ends. As it turns out—- alas—- it's the odds and ends that are the **real stars of the website**, rather than my brilliant writings.

For example, the most popular Google query that led people to my site this month was for someone named [Pavan Ahluwalia](http://www.google.com/search?q=pavan+ahluwalia). I do not know Pavan. But when I was in graduate school, I wrote a column for the [student daily](http://www.dailyprincetonian.com) and so did he. Once, I mentioned him in one of my columns, a copy of which lives on in the [archives](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/files/columns/bicker.html). In fact, Princeton-related searches are absurdly common in the log. ["Cottage Club Princeton Tradition"](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&safe=off&q=cottage+club+princeton+tradition) will lead you back here, for one. As will ["Princeton Nude Olympics"](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&safe=off&q=princeton+nude+olympics), eventually.

The most popular search query leading to my website, though, is not Princeton-related. Needless to say, it has nothing to do with sociology, either. Instead, it's the \#2 result about [an inappropriate response to a cry for help](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&safe=off&q=clippy+suicide).
