[Jacob Levy](http://volokh.blogspot.com/2003_04_06_volokh_archive.html#200111298) points out that the *NYT* only one a single Pulitzer price this year. But he also sensibly notes that this isn't such a big deal: there were no *NYT* winners in 2000, for example.

**Empirical Task**: Visit bloggers who (unlike Jacob) suffer from [acute Timesophobia](http://www.andrewsullivan) and see whether any of them suggest the dearth of Pulitzers is a judgment on the malign influence of Howell Raines.

**Thought Experiment**: Assume the Times had won many Pulitzers, and ask whether Timesophobes would view this as a further indictment of a corrupt, backscratching liberal media establishment.
