As I write, the latest version of [R](http://www.r-project.org/) is compiling in the background on my workstation. R is a high-quality language and environment for statistical computing. It's related to the S language developed at Bell Labs which is now marketed as the commercial package [S-Plus](http://www.insightful.com/products/product.asp?PID=10). R is a terrific statistics package. I use it for all of my quantitative data analysis. It's powerful, flexible and full-featured. It's developed by a top-notch community of statisticians who provide amazing on-line support to users. It's got a growing, and very strong, literature of [introductory](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0387954759) texts, [companions](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0761922806) to existing textbooks, implementing [modern statistical methods](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0387954570), [regression modeling strategies](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0387952322), specialized [types of models](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0387989579) and [programming techniques](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0387989668). Its structure encourages the user to learn more about good statistical practice rather than relying on canned menu-driven routines. It's available for a wide variety of platforms, including Windows, Macintosh, Linux and other Unix-based OSes and processors. And it's Free. In short, it's the best kind of open-source software project. You don't hear about it very often because many Linux users care more about their [desktop](http:/www.gnome.org) or their [mp3](http://www.xmms.org/) player.

I run R inside of [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html), the powerful text editor. A plug-in for Emacs called [ESS](http://software.biostat.washington.edu/statsoft/ess/) (Emacs Speaks Statistics) supports R and makes working in R very easy. (It does the same for S, SAS, Stata and other programs, too.) Here's an obligatory
