Besides double espressos in the morning and vodka tonics a bit later in the morning, I mean. Books, books, books.

[Social Structures](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691127115/ref=nosim?link_code=as3&creativeASIN=0691127115&creative=373489&camp=211189), by John Levi Martin. I started reading this at six o'clock this morning while waiting at my departure gate, which was perhaps unwise. Two flights, five cups of coffee and three muffins later, I am in the middle of Chapter 4 and up to my neck in scribbled marginal notes.

[Inventing Equal Opportunity](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691137439/ref=nosim?link_code=as3&creativeASIN=0691137439&creative=373489&camp=211189), by Frank Dobbin. I hadn't heard this one was out, and was very pleased to see it on display.

[Backstage at the Revolution: How the Royal Paris Opera Survived the End of the Old Regime](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226401952/ref=nosim?link_code=as3&creativeASIN=0226401952&creative=373489&camp=211189), by Victoria Johnson. The Jacobins were bent on destroying the old regime, but neglected to raze the Paris Opera. Why? Victoria Johnson knows.

[The Scientific Life: A Moral History of a Late Modern Vocation](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226750248/ref=nosim?link_code=as3&creativeASIN=0226750248&creative=373489&camp=211189), by Steven Shapin. The moral dimension of the practice of science. Looks interesting.

[Framing Finance](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226679322/ref=nosim?link_code=as3&creativeASIN=0226679322&creative=373489&camp=211189), by Alex Preda. From Stock Jobbers to Superquants. What a long, strange trip it's been.

[Material Markets: How economic agents are constructed](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199278156/ref=nosim?link_code=as3&creativeASIN=0199278156&creative=373489&camp=211189), by Donald MacKenzie. Performativity is like those deep-fried Mars bars you get in Glasgow chippies. An unexpected juxtaposition of properties. Off-putting yet strangely intriguing. You taste it and it makes you feel a little weird. You promise yourself you won't try that again. The following week you're on the way home from the pub and you buy another one.
