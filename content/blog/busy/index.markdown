Looks like blogging is going to be pretty light this week, and probably non-existent next week, for a mix of work and personal reasons. I'm sure you'll all cope. All you need to remember are four things:

1 It's [a good cause](http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2003_03_02_oxblog_archive.html#90088316), but the [guys in charge](http://www.agonist.org/archives/000697.html#000697) are going to [screw it up](http://www.agonist.org/archives/000698.html#000698). Incidentally, although the U.S. state is the most powerful organization in the world, it's not some kind of omnipotent godlike force. There is a word to describe **the mistake of thinking that because one is *most powerful*, one is also *all powerful***. That word is ['hubris'](http://www.dailypundit.com/archives/008472.php#008472).

2 [Torturing people to advance democracy](http://calpundit.blogspot.com/2003_03_02_calpundit_archive.html#90377295) is a really bad idea.

3 [Jim Capozzola for senate](http://rittenhouse.blogspot.com/2003_03_01_rittenhouse_archive.html#90419337). If I lived in Pennsylvania I'd vote for him, if I had a vote.

4 Always back up and write down your hardware info [before installing Linux](http://junius.blogspot.com/2003_03_09_junius_archive.html#90428718). Remember, Chris, Linux is only free if your time has no value. (Bear in mind that Windows actually makes you pay to waste your time trying to fix it, though.)
