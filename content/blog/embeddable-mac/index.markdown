Here's an emulated Macintosh SE running System 7.1, courtesy of [Infinite Mac's embedder](https://infinitemac.org/embed), which you can learn more about [at this blog post by Mihai Parparita](https://blog.persistent.info/2025/07/infinite-mac-embedding.html). The emulator is fully functional once it boots up. You may get one or two error dialogs during the boot process but you can just OK past them and things will work.

Getting the classic 68k Macintosh experience like this is certainly less trouble than [other ways of doing it](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2022/02/14/desktop-mac/).
