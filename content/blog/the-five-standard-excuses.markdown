If I were less tired, I would write a post exploring the applicability, in our post-WMD world, of [The Five Standard Excuses for any Failed Government Project](http://www.yes-minister.com/polterms.htm#5%20Standard%20Excuses) described by Sir Humphrey in [Yes, Minister](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008DP4B/kieranhealysw-20/ref=nosim/). I conjecture that some varietal of each of them will be found in talk about Iraq as [prior certainties](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22we+know+he+has+weapons+of+mass+destruction%22&btnG=Google+Search) about Saddam's monstrous armaments [evaporate](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/001248.html). The excuses are as follows:

> 1. There is a perfectly satisfactory explanation for everything but security prevents its disclosure. (The [Anthony Blunt](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/blunt_anthony.shtml) excuse.)
>  2. It has only gone wrong because of heavy cuts in staff and budget which have stretched supervisory resources beyond the limit.
>  3. It was a worthwhile experiment now abandoned, but not before it provided much valuable data and considerable employment. (The [Concorde](http://www.concorde-jet.com/) excuse.)
>  4. It occurred before certain important facts were known and could not happen again. (The [Munich Agreement](http://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~jobrien/reference/ob66.html) excuse.)
>  5. It was an unfortunate lapse by an individual now being dealt with under internal disciplinary procedures. (The [Charge of the Light Brigade](http://www.nationalcenter.org/ChargeoftheLightBrigade.html) excuse.)

Some of these excuses have been employed by the U.S. government for some time, notably (1). A version of (2) is also [becoming more popular](http://www.axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/article_4959.shtml) with them. These excuses also do double-duty as rationales that *critics* impute to the Bush administration. Many, for instance, will favor some version of (4) or (5) in an attempt to resist alternative theories involving vulgar phrases like "blithely imperialist" or "neoconservative maniacs," simply because of the [appalling vista](http://media.guardian.co.uk/huttoninquiry/story/0,13812,1136485,00.html) suggested by the latter views. I personally find it worrying that the administration's choices in domestic and foreign policy are starting to [puzzle clever economists](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004_archives/000130.html). These, after all, are people who by temperament and training will bend over backwards till their spines snap before saying the words, "Yeah, I guess you'd have to say that was pretty irrational." If those guys give up on you, you're really doing badly.
