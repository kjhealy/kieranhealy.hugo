[High Concept](http://www.writersstore.com/product.php?products_id=263) for a Horror movie: The [Constitution](http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html) *really is* a [living document](http://www.google.com/search?q=constitution+living+document&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). Key scenes:

-   Night. CONSTITUTION escapes from display case in Library of Congress. Seen lurking in alleyway off of Mass Ave. Shadows. Attacks and eats [Cato Institute](http://www.cato.org) INTERN.
-   Day. The NATIONAL GUARD attempt to capture the Constitution on the Mall. Suddenly, ARTICLE III is invoked in a novel way. The GUARDSMEN find themselves guilty of treason and are forced to arrest themselves.
-   Morning. Quiet alley. Constitution hides in a dumpster. We hear it interpreting itself in a high-pitched chatter. BABY AMENDMENTS push up the dumpster lid and escape into the city.
-   A home office. A MAN sits at a computer. The Constitution moves stealthily behind him, past a banner on the wall reading 'Proud to be a Resident Scholar at the [AEI](http://www.aei.org/).' He hears a noise behind him, turns and brandishes a gun. The Constitution quickly reinterprets the SECOND AMENDMENT and the gun disappears. The Man looks at his hand in horror, and then up at the advancing AMENDMENT. Fade Out.
-   Day. Golf Course. The EIGHTH AMENDMENT appears from the heavy rough and devours Justice [SCALIA](http://balkin.blogspot.com/2004_02_15_balkin_archive.html#107711660024967338) from the legs up. Vice President CHENEY putts to save par, makes some adjustments to Scalia's scorecard, and smiles quietly to himself.

The linking scenes pretty much write themselves. Call me for a complete synopsis.
