> Others will enter the gates of the ferry, and cross from shore to shore;
>  Others will watch the run of the flood-tide;
>  Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and east;
>  Others will see the islands large and small;
>  Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour high;
>  A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see them,
>  Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring in of the flood-tide,
>  the falling back to the sea of the ebb-tide.

â€”- Walt Whitman, [Crossing Brooklyn Ferry](http://www.bartleby.com/142/86.html).
