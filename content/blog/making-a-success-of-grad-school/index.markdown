Let's say you've already read Tim Burke's "[Should I Go to Grad School?](http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?page_id=4)" and pushed on past the short answer. ("No.") Then it's time to read Fontana Labs' [Twelve-Step Guide](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2005_09_25.html#004083) to life while you're there. Your experience of a graduate program will depend in part on each of (1) The field you're in, (2) The quality of the program, (3) Your own attributes, (4) The strategy you pursue. Once you go down the chute and find yourself in a particular setting, (1) and (2) are exogenous in the short run, and at the beginning you have no real sense of the social structure of the field anyway. So FL's advice sensibly emphasizes the difference between undergraduate and graduate education and what that should mean for your approach to it. To boil it down to a one-line characterization: in academic environments, expectations are high and monitoring is low (but decisive when it happens). Many grad-student pathologies spring from a failure to deal with this problem.
