[Matthew Yglesias](http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/003079.html#003079 "Matthew Yglesias: Gays and Genes") and [Kevin Drum](http://calpundit.blogspot.com/2003_04_06_calpundit_archive.html#92374289) both comment on a survey that Republicans think, by a margin of 61-39, that homosexuality is caused by upbringing; whereas Democrats opt for genes by a margin of 66-34.

This confirms a throwaway comment I read a few years ago, I think in the context of the *Bell Curve* debate. Conservatives think that *everything except* being gay is determined by the genes and Liberals think *nothing but* being gay is caused by genes. There's a moral there somewhere.

**Update**: [MacDiva](http://www.macaronies.blogspot.com) has some comments.
