From a WP story [about the conclave](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6132-2005Apr20.html):

> Although the cardinals swore an oath of perpetual secrecy about what occurred in the conclave, many began to talk about it on Wednesday.

I know it's impossible to properly conceive of eternity within the finitute of the human mind, but you'd think the Cardinals might have done better than "about 24 hours after the Conclave." Still, the article is worth a read for its glimpse of the politics of the Church at its highest levels.
