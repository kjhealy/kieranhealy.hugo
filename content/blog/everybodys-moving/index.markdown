[Slugger O'Toole](http://www.sluggerotoole.com/home/index.asp "Slugger O'Toole") has a new design and [Jeff Cooper](http://www.jeffcoop.com/blog) has a new home. Both of them are running Movable Type, but neither of them have the [TrackBack](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000026.html#000026) feature turned on. Switch it on, guys! It's one of MT's best features! If you used it, I wouldn't have to stand here shouting, in the hope you'd hear me!
