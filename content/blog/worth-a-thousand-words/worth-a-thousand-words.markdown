![image](%3CMTAmazonMediumImage%3E) I just finished reading Larry Gonick's [](;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/%3Cbr%20/%3E%0A%3CMTAmazonASIN%3E/%3CMTAmazonAssociateID%3E/ref=nosim/).

Yes, yes, I know I *ought* to be constantly poring over [](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN%3CMTAmazonASIN%3E/%3CMTAmazonAssociateID%3E/ref=nosim/) by the McNeills, or Michael Mann's [](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/%3CMTAmazonASIN%3E%3CMTAmazonAssociateID%3E/ref=nosim/), or (for local color) Kenneth Pomerantz's [](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/%3CMTAmazonASIN%3E/%3CMTAmazonAssociateID%3E/ref=nosim/) And in fact I may have looked into these here and there. But where's the fun? Trying to keep track of the details of theories of world-historical development is like being on some nightmare episode of *Jeopardy*:

![image](%3CMTAmazonMediumImage%3E) Gonick's epic cartoon version covers all that stuff incisively, reliably and with better jokes. The earlier volumes deal with a lot more besides. The original [Cartoon History of the Universe](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/%3CMTAmazonASIN%3E/%3CMTAmazonAssociateID%3E/ref=nosim/) starts at the beginning (the Big Bang) and goes up to Alexander the Great. The [second volume](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/%3CMTAmazonASIN%3E/%3CMTAmazonAssociateID%3E/ref=nosim/) takes us from the Springtime of China to the Fall of Rome. Altogether highly recommended.
