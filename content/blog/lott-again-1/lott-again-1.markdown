It seems that John Lott may be [quoting himself at one remove](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/guns/lott98update3.html#2003-04-14 "John Lott's Mysterious Survey") in his new book. The natural next step is for Lott to *falsely* quote himself, and after that to lose the source of the false quotation, but use it anyway. (If you don't know what all this is about, [read this](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/guns/lott98update3.html).)
