And I got this cool present:

[![Penguin 60s](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/60s-sm.jpg)](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/60s-lg.jpg)

These are Penguin 60s, the original (orange) series and the Classics, which Penguin brought out in 1995 for their 60th anniversary. (They recently issued a similar series for their 70th, though not in the United States.) When they came out I really wanted the Classics collection, but had no money. I remember there was a certain amount of snotty declensionist commentary on the sort of people who would only spend 60p for excerpts of Civilization rather than reading the originals entire. Well, you can always have [The Complete Penguin Classics](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0147503078/ref=nosim/) delivered to your house for a mere $7,989.50 (don't worry, shipping is free). If you're not up to that, just take [The American Collection](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0147503221/ref=nosim/) or the [19th Century British Collection](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0147503213/ref=nosim/) instead, which are a bit cheaper.
