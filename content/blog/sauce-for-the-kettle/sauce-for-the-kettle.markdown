Or possibly the pot is calling the goose a gander. Or something. Anyway, [Tacitus](http://www.tacitus.org/archives/000468.html#000468) says

> One of the truly annoying things about so much of the leftist internet commentariat is their assumption that anyone on the right is ipso facto a die hard supporter of the President. This is ridiculous on its face … Obviously there are many different flavors of conservatives …

Well *obviously* there are. Not like so much of the leftist internet commentariat. Man are they ever homogenous.

But I forgive Tacitus, partly because he is a great Roman historian, but mostly because I would forgive anyone who could write a [sentence](http://www.tacitus.org/archives/000468.html#000468) like "I think I have a pretty good handle on the rules of thumb on this."
