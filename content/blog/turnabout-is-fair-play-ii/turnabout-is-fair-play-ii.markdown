Accidents happen. But the various responses (official and unofficial) being put forth on Cheney's behalf get ever more weird. They include: (1) Whittington didn't get a shotgun blast in the face, he was merely [peppered](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/13/AR2006021300452.html) with a [pellet gun](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/007677.php). (2) Cheney has [paid his seven bucks](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_02/008219.php). (This seems to be the only official response from the Vice President's office so far.) (3) No need for a statement from Cheney saying he feels terrible about what happened, because Whittington has already [accepted responsibility for the accident](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/14/politics/14cheney.html?ex=1297573200&en=e27b5767f6e44679&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss). It was totally his fault. (4) Besides, why should [anyone have been interested](http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2006/02/mcclellan_grill.html) that the Vice President of the United States shot someone in the face? I mean, (5) [People get shot in the face all the time](http://powerlineblog.com/archives/013138.php) while out hunting, and you'd know it if you weren't a liberal, east-coast, latte-drinking effete snob.

Prize for most bizarre exculpatory counterfactual goes to (6) "If Cheney had been trout fishing and a companion had walked behind him as he started to cast, so that [he inadvertently snagged his friend](http://tbogg.blogspot.com/2006/02/warning-innate-ignorance-ahead-least.html), resulting in a hospital visit, would we have seen this kind of frenzy? I don't think so." The counterfactual *I* have in mind is a bit more relevant: what if it were Whittington who had shot—er, sprayed—*Cheney* in the face, in an otherwise identical fashion? How would things be playing out amongst the VP's defenders? Would they be blaming him for being stupid enough to walk into a hail of shotgun pellets? Do you think we'd have seen no more than a quick photo of Whittington [skulking back home](http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2006/02/still_more_ques.html), with no word of apology or expression of embarrassed regret? Do you think Cheney would be accepting responsibility for the accident from his ICU bed?
