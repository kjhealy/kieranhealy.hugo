Guest-blogging over at Volokh, Cathy Seipp tells us [why we should learn French rather than Spanish:](http://volokh.com/posts/1090100809.shtml)

> Last year, when she took French at Pasadena Community College, we got the same reaction: "Why French? Why not Spanish? Isn't that more useful around here?" Well, no. What's useful in Los Angeles, just like everywhere else in the country, is English. I suppose if I were a contractor rounding up day laborers every morning, and wanted my daughter to learn the family business, Spanish would be invaluable. ... I do speak enough Spanish to communicate with the cleaning lady … This is sort of useful, but not vital.

> Since 1066, educated English speakers have studied French. Even if we don't speak it … it gives us a deeper understanding of our own language, and prevents embarrassing gaffes like "I just love that Why-vees Saint Laurent!" Which some trophy wife actually said to me at a fashion show once.

An example of the kind of embarrassing gaffe that the study of French seems powerless to prevent is left as an exercise to the reader.
