From [ITO](http://www.itoworld.com/) comes this very nice—and very sobering—map of [road accident fatalities in the United States](http://map.itoworld.com/road-casualties-usa#) between 2001 and 2009. As someone who [wrote a book](http://www.amazon.com/Last-Best-Gifts-Altruism-Market/dp/0226322378/) about blood and organ donation in Europe and the United States, I've spent time analyzing [NHTSA](http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx) data on traffic accidents. I remember that, during Q&As at talks, people were often surprised to learn just how many road deaths there are in the U.S.: about forty thousand per annum (though 2009 saw a very sharp drop, interestingly). Of course, people drive a great deal, too. Standardized by miles traveled, the rate is about 1.5 per 100 million vehicle miles. Still, the absolute number is striking: about two full Boeing 747s' worth every week of the year.

You can zoom in to the precise location of every accident on the map. Each dot is a life. Drive safely this Thanksgiving.
