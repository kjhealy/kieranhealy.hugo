I've been using the [Readmill](http://readmill.com/) ebook reader on-and-off. I like it quite a bit. Using it prompted me to make an ebook of my own. Because I moved this entire blog over to [Octopress](http://octopress.org) a little while ago, everything I've ever written on it going back to 2002 is now in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format. So over lunch today I took advantage of John MacFarlane's amazingly useful [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), which can [make EUPB format ebooks](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/epub.html) out of markdown files, selected thirteen posts from the [Archives](http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives) and made a little anthology called [Books I Did Not Read This Year](http://kieranhealy.org/ebook/Healy-Books-I-Did-Not-Read-This-Year.epub). It's [free to download](http://kieranhealy.org/ebook/Healy-Books-I-Did-Not-Read-This-Year.epub), because I'm such a generous person. Enjoy it on Readmill, iBooks, your Kindle, or any other EPUB-compatible reader. Daniel kindly made [a Mobi version for Kindle owners](http://kieranhealy.org/ebook/healy-books-i-did-not-read-this-year.mobi). I plan on making a few more of these, forming a Press (e.g. "Harbard University Press" or "Pengiun"), and then adding them to my Vita.
