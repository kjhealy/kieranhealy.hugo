As I've said often before, [TrackBack](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/blog/archives/000029.html#000029) is a great idea, and the more people who use it the better. So this post is just here to ping [What She Really Thinks](http://www.whiterose.org/ginger/arch/week_2002_09_01.html#001185), who has just switched on her TrackBack feature.
