[This article](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/09/fashion/thursdaystyles/09parents.html?ex=1299560400&en=7648de7bc1e0a6dc&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) in the Times is about the dangers to children, real and imagined, of social networking websites. The usual ping-pong back-and-forth about MySpace, etc. I liked the tag-line, though: "Parents fear Web predators. Some Internet experts, and some kids, call that fear overblown." Other parental fears that "some kids" strenuously call overblown: the fear that the kid will spend some huge amount of money if given the chance, the fear that the kid will take the car and crash it at the first opportunity, the fear that the kid will have a big old party in your house while you're away, etc, etc. Compare these reassurances to their near-perfect complement, [stern warnings from the AMA](http://www.tpmcafe.com/node/27655) to 19-year-olds about to head off to Rocky Point for the week: "The American Medical Association is warning girls not to go wild during spring break after conducting a survey in which 83 percent of college women and graduates admit spring break involves heavier-than- usual drinking, and 74 percent saying the break results in increased sexual activity." You don't say! Both are subject to a well-developed Bayesian filter by their intended audience (parents in the first case, spring-breakers in the second) where the probability of the information being worthwhile is weighted by its source and then rapidly disregarded.
