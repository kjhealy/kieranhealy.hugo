Watch closely to see an interesting bit of rhetorical misdirection from Stanley Fish, in his [Op-Ed piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/30/opinion/30FISH.html?pagewanted=2 "One Man's Opinion") in today's *Times*. He appears to be rebutting those who think Clarence Thomas acted in bad faith by voting to strike down the kind of Affirmative Action policies Thomas may himself have benefitted from:

> In fact the opinion is a repudiation of the personal in favor of the principles of justice … [Thomas finds] that the clause forbids discrimination on the basis of race, whether that discrimination is benign or malign in intention … Justice Thomas [is] squarely in a philosophical tradition that begins with Kant's insistence that questions of justice turn only on abstract considerations of what is right rather than on the calculation of (someone's) preferred outcomes.

A personalized reading of Thomas's decision is therefore unjustified:

> I merely want to insist that arguments are what he is trafficking in, and that while his affinity for those arguments may have its source in his biography, **that (sociological) fact should be irrelevant** to our assessment of them. [Emphasis added.]

Bravo Mr Fish, say the [conservative commentators](http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2003_06_29_oxblog_archive.html#105696385871361698). It's the general argument that matters, and the reasons we may adduce for it, not mere "sociological" facts about Thomas or any other justice. To adopt a phrase from [Michael Bowen](http://www.mdcbowen.org/cobb/archives/000204.html), Thomas is one of "those who see any racial discrimination as racist regardless of intent to exclude." He is consistently applying a general rule of non-discrimination. Accusing Thomas of bad faith is no different from (and no less absurd than) saying the same about a [white abolitionist in 1850](http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2003_06_22_oxblog_archive.html#105666982950406857) or a [male judge ruling against sex discrimination in the 1970s](http://volokh.com/2003_06_22_volokh_archive.html#105673832268504702).

Yet, in his *very next sentence*, Fish says:

> A proper assessment [of Thomas's general argument] might begin by challenging the assumption that neutral principles, abstracted from history, are capable all by themselves of deciding **issues that arise only in historical circumstances** ... Indeed, **everything about the law is particular**: the wrongs, the remedies, the moment at which they intersect in an effort to make things better … Justice Thomas is not the only one in search of timeless tools to deal with the untidiness of the situations time throws up … But I believe this search has failed, and therefore we will always be engaging in the ad hoc, pragmatic reasoning of which Justice Thomas accuses the majority. [Emphasis added.]

So Thomas's critics are wrong because they point to particular sociological facts about the justices and their background when they should be engaging with the general, timeless arguments in his opinions. Yet Thomas is wrong because there is no such thing as a general, timeless argument, only a mosaic of particular historical facts and particular pragmatic responses to them!

The rhetorical success of the piece turns on the fact that "sociological" is likely to be read as a pejorative adjective, whereas "historical" is likely not to be. And so Fish can discount the particularistic, sociological argument of the critics in one breath (to the applause of conservatives) and make the same pragmatic, historical argument in the next. (The conservatives don't notice because they're still clapping.) I suspect the ability to talk like this is one of the things that makes Fish a good Dean.
