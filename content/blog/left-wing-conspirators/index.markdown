Via [Atrios](http://atrios.blogspot.com/2004_02_15_atrios_archive.html#107694748162031817) and [RMPN](http://www.rmpn.org/weblog/archives/permalink/001104.cfm) I found a beta version of [FollowTheNetwork.Org](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/default.cfm). Apparently the brainchild of David Horowitz, it purports to be "a guide to the political left" and takes the form of a big database of people, funders, media, government and so on. The design of the site suggests that the left is a huge, interconnected web of shadowy figures and money flows. The database entries make for interesting reading. Trawling around in it (note that the site is in beta, so these links may stop working soon) I find that you can "follow the network" for people like these:

-   [Troy Duster](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/personsDetail.cfm?pid=69). Described as a "Radical black sociologist." Duster teaches at NYU is a past-president of the [American Sociological Association](http://www.asanet.org).

-   [Jamal Ahmen Al-Fadl](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/personsDetail.cfm?pid=184). Described as "bin Laden lieutenant, Sudanese … Helped Sudan's ruling NIF build world's then-largest complex of terrorist training camps."

-   [Bruce Ackerman](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/personsDetail.cfm?pid=324), "'Progressive' academic." Ackerman is [Sterling Professor of Law and Political Science](http://www.law.yale.edu/outside/html/faculty/baa27/profile.htm) at Yale University.

-   [Ben Ali Zinedine](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/personsDetail.cfm?pid=127), " President General of Tunisia's democratic government."

-   [Joan Baez](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/personsDetail.cfm?pid=27), "singer, radical."

-   [Osama Bin Laden](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/personsDetail.cfm?pid=178), "Saudi Arabian financier … Issued fatwa calling for Muslims to kill Americans and Jews everywhere in the world. CIA notified Congress of this."

-   [Barbara Reskin](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/personsDetail.cfm?pid=315), "progressive academic." Reskin is professor of sociology at the [University of Washington](http://www.soc.washington.edu/people/faculty/faculty_detail.asp?UID=reskin) and a former president of the American Sociological Association.

-   [Ahmad A. Ajaj](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/personsDetail.cfm?showHeader=No&pid=117), " Associate of first WTC bombers. From Houston. Pizza deliveryman. 'Mysterious connections and unlimited funds.'"

-   [Mary Waters](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/personsDetail.cfm?showHeader=No&pid=455), "'Progressive'" academic. Waters is Professor of Sociology and Chair of the Department at [Harvard University](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/waters/)

-   [Mohammed Ali](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/personsDetail.cfm?showHeader=No&pid=121), "Special operations chief for Osama bin Laden in USA."

-   [Ayman Al-Zawhiri](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/personsDetail.cfm?showHeader=No&pid=192) is "Second in command of al-Qaeda."

I could go on. And that's just the database of individuals. There's also the [list of groups](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/groups.cfm), where you can find invaluable information on terrorist groups like [Hamas](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/organizationsDetail.cfm?orgid=66&chksearch=organizations&type=alphaα=H), [Habitat for Humanity](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/organizationsDetail.cfm?orgid=2754&chksearch=organizations&type=alphaα=H) and the [Harvard Alumni Association](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/organizationsDetail.cfm?orgid=5977&chksearch=organizations&type=alphaα=H). And like any good blacklist, everyone is [invited to submit any information they might have](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/contribute.cfm).

**Update**: Blogger [Jack Balkin](http://balkin.blogspot.com/) is [on the list](http://www.followthenetwork.org/uidev/personsDetail.cfm?pid=398), as another "'Progressive' Academic." What are we at CT? Chopped Liver?

**Update 2**: It seems like the Follow The Network has been taken offline, but those helpful people at [RMPN](http://www.rmpn.org/weblog/) have a [Mirror Site](http://www.thinkpol.net/ftnmir1/) for you all to play with.
