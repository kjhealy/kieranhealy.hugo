[Here's something](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/hitchhike.pdf) I'd forgotten I'd written. An early, co-authored publication of mine in ASQ. Sadly, only the first page survives. In case you're unfamiliar with the topic, I should say that the bibliographical references and quotations are all perfectly accurate. Any resemblance to [this paper](http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&se=gglsc&d=5001869630) is wholly accidental.
