First week of the Fall semester in [sunny Tucson](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/camera/). New classes, new students—including the undersocialized ones who come into your office asking to use the phone—and an uptick of amusing activity in the [Police Blotter](http://wildcat.arizona.edu/papers/98/2/01_50.html). The Blotter is kind of a litany ("reports stated") of the joys of being young, engaged in illegal activity, and perhaps a little slow off the mark:

> A student was referred to the diversion program for possession of marijuana in the courtyard between Coronado and La Aldea, 822 E. Fifth St., Friday at 10:23 p.m., reports stated.
>
> Police smelled burning marijuana coming from the area and saw the student who had red, bloodshot eyes and whose breath smelled of marijuana, reports stated.
>
> Police asked the student if he had any marijuana on him and he said he had smoked earlier but didn't have any on him and said, "You can check me," reports stated.
>
> At that point he put his hands in his pockets and said "Oh yeah, I have a little," reports stated.

These are the people I have to interest in the transition from Feudalism to Capitalism. As it turns out, it can be easier than you might think (when they're not stoned). For instance, you can go a long way with a discussion of the division of labor that begins with the question "Why are there nearly a million people living [here in the desert](http://www.oneworldjourneys.com/sonoran/index2.html)?"
