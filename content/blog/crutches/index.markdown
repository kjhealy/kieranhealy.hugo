Seeing as [Kevin](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_09/004634.php) is wondering whether M&Ms have gotten smaller since the last time he looked[1], my imponderable for the day is this: Why is it that in Europe (at least in my experience) patients with a sprained ankle or whatever are typically issued with [forearm crutches](http://www.bentonmedical.com/forearm.html) whereas in the U.S. you get [underarm crutches](http://www.bentonmedical.com/underarm.html). It seems clear to me that the underarm kind is inferior in every important respect. So why does it survive in the U.S.?

Possible explanations:

-   **Efficiency**. Already ruled out. Underarm crutches are inferior.
-   **Revealed Preferences**. Underarm crutches *must* be more efficient because otherwise people wouldn't be buying them.
-   **Path Dependence**. Some QWERTY-like event in the early 1900s locked American hospitals into the underarm regime.
-   **Cultural**. De Tocqueville notes somewhere that American individualism thrives in the presence of underarm supports for gammy legs, while the *ancien regime*'s tendency to lean at the elbow meant that its collapse was both inevitable and unforseen.
-   **Marxist**. The ruling crutches of any epoch are the crutches of the ruling class, etc.
-   **Evolutionary Psychology**. On the Pleistocene Savannah, Underarm crutches provided a selective advantage to their users due to their greater length, enabling Underarm-using groups to hold off predators at a slightly greater distance and obtain marginally higher-hanging fruit than their Forearm-using competitors.
-   **Political Economy**. A cartel of crutch producers in league with hospital crutch-wranglers and has cornered the market through aggressive undercutting of the competition and a complex system of kickbacks. *Standard Crutch (New Jersey)* pioneered this technique in the 19th century, bringing it to such a pitch of perfection that it was impossible to buy a forearm model without also getting three underarm models delivered to you.
-   **Libertarian**. Though technically inferior, underarm models are ultimately beneficial because they encourage a quicker return to standing on your own two feet.

Alternative explanations (perhaps even informative ones) are invited.

fn1. Perhaps they are simply further away than before?
