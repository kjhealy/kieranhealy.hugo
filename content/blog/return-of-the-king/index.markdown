I went to see *The Return of the King* on Stephen's Day, which was opening day in Australia. As the Nazgul were dive-bombing the crap out of everything during the battle of the Pelennor Fields, I found myself wondering whether there was a deputy assistant undersecretary from Gondor's Defence of the Realm Department hiding under his kitchen table somewhere on the fifth level of Minas Tirith thinking, "I must have written *dozens* of memos about Mordor's air superiority, but would they listen, oh noooo! Just like every *other* year, the whole goddamn budget was blown on horses, silver filigree and whitewash."
