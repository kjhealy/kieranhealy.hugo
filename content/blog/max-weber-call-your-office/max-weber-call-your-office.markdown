Via the excellent [Julian Sanchez](http://www.juliansanchez.com/notes.html "Julian's Lounge: Notes from the Lounge") comes [this snippet](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57541-2003May14.html) illustrating the difference between [traditional and legal-rational authority](http://www.sociology.org.uk/wspo3.htm). Tom DeLay wants to smoke in Tom Khandker's restaurant:

> Khandker: "I'm sorry, sir, but this is a federal building, and it's against the law of the federal government."
>
> DeLay: "I *am* the federal government."
>
> But Khandker stood his ground, and DeLay and several cigar-chomping compatriots left for the smoke-filled Caucus Room before the cheesecake course.

It's just occured to me that if *anyone* is entitled to call his office, it's Weber. He practically invented [offices](http://wizard.ucr.edu/~bkaplan/soc/lib/webrbur2.html) *and* [calling](http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/WEBER/WeberCH3.html).
