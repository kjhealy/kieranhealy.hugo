Via [Inevitable Backlash](http://www.inevitablebacklash.com%22) comes a link to an informative page all about [CSS layout techniques](http://www.glish.com/css/). Make your site look spiffier with good HTML today. Eventually I will get around to rewriting my [main page](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kjhealy) so it uses cascading style sheets instead of tables. But, seeing as the semester starts on Monday, this probably won't happen soon.
