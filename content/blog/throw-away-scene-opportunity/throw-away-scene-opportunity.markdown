Seeing as Pirates of the Caribbean II is coming out soon, I wonder whether it's too late to get Johnny Depp back into the studio for a gratuitous falling-out-of-a-palm-tree scene, as a hat-tip to his character's inspiration. Seems like an obvious option (I mean, *I* thought of it). Though seeing as Richards had post-accident brain surgery recently, maybe the studio doesn't want to risk it.
