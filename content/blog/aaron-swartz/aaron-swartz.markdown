Aaron Swartz [took his own life](http://rememberaaronsw.tumblr.com) yesterday. He was twenty six. Like many millions of writers and internet users, I use things every day that he had a hand in creating, improving, or catalyzing, whether directly or indirectly, well-known or less so: RSS, Markdown, JSTOR, other things. 

Like many thousands of people, I had some contact with him via email, blogs, and twitter over the years. I gave him some data he asked for once. He contributed [guest posts](http://crookedtimber.org/author/aaron_swartz/) to Crooked Timber. He had a terrific grasp of sociology, by the way, and a far better facility with it than many people who think they have a "sociological imagination". He pushed something my way once that I stupidly failed to take advantage of. [I made him laugh a few times](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2011). 

Unlike some people, I was not his friend, or confidant, or co-worker, or family. To them, I can only say I am sorry. He was so obviously a remarkable man, even at a distance. I wish the U.S. government had not hounded him on such an empty pretext. I wish he had found some other way to cope with his illness. 

*Bímid buan ar buairt gach ló*<br /> 
*Ag caoi go cruaidh 's ag tuar na ndeor*<br /> 
*Mar scaoileadh uainn an buachaill beo*

I am sorry he is gone.
