My [department](http://fp.arizona.edu/soc/) has a job offer out to Emory's [Lane Kenworthy](http://www.emory.edu/SOC/lkenworthy/), a comparative macro-sociologist. We hope he accepts, of course, because his stuff is very interesting. His homepage has a list of his [papers](http://www.emory.edu/SOC/lkenworthy/publications.html), along with various datasets. He also has a complete draft of a forthcoming book, [*Egalitarian Capitalism*](http://www.emory.edu/SOC/lkenworthy/egalitariancapitalism.pdf) [2mb PDF]. It's an examination of trends in growth, employment and income in 20 of the advanced capitalist democracies. The analytical focus is on whether there is a tradeoff between each of these desirable goals, on the one hand, and income equality, on the other. The general conclusion is that there is no such tradeoffâ€”- or at least, the kind of income distribution that would look very good to egalitarians can be achieved without substantial sacrifices to economic growth. *Egalitarian Capitalism* is very accessible to the general reader, I think, and relevant to the question "If not the [](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/001213.html)New Economy, then what?" that's been suggested by our [ongoing]() [discussion](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/001222.html) on [Crooked Timber](http://www.crookedtimber.org/) of Doug Henwood's book.
