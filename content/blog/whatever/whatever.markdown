It irritates me that, in the wake of the loss of the Shuttle, [Glenn Reynolds](http://www.instapundit.com/archives/007196.php#007196) can say in one breath,

> This won't traumatize people the way Challenger did because (1) it's not the first time; and (2) we're at war now, and people's calculations of such things—especially post-WTC—are different.

and then a few paragraphs later in the *same post* complain that French television isn't giving it enough coverage because, you know, they're French and hate us and all. Bleah. Give it a rest, already.
