There's an old law of software development that says every application expands to the point where it can read mail. A little-known corollary is that [Google](http://www.google.com) can always do more than you think.

For example, try searching for expressions like [213 &lowast; 718](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=213*718), or [76 kilos in pounds](http://www.google.com/search?q=76+kilos+in+pounds&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), or even [(G &lowast; mass of Earth) / (radius of Earth^2)](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=(G+*+mass+of+earth)+/+(radius+of+earth+%5E+2)). Amazing. Wait till [Brad DeLong](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2003_archives/cat_computers_google.html) hears about itâ€¦

**Update**: Naturally, the google calculator also knows the [answer to life, the universe and everything](http://www.google.com/search?q=answer+to+life,+the+universe,+and+everything). (Hat tip: [Geek Notes](http://semantics-online.org/geek/2003/08/google_web_calc).)
