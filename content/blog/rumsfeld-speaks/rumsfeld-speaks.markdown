The incomparable [Fafblog](http://fafblog.blogspot.com/) interviews Donald Rumsfeld:

> FAFBLOG: Great to have you here Donald Rumsfeld! Lets get right to it an start by askin: what is with this torture thing, and how long have you known about it?
>  DONALD RUMSFELD: Good gosh, that's a tricky one there. Was it torture? Were detainees indefinitely held for days with bags over their heads? Yes. Were testicles electrocuted? You bet. Were orifices molested, flesh ripped by dogs, and nostils raped? Almost certainly. But torture? Hard to say.
>  FB: Wow â€“ that IS hard to say.
>  DR: It sure is.
