What must it be like to see the world from inside [David Bernstein's head](http://volokh.com/2003_11_16_volokh_archive.html#106943537550096145)?

> QUOTE OF THE DAY: [A London attorney](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=514&e=3&u=/ap/20031120/ap_on_re_eu/bush_protests_19):"You will never change the hearts and minds of terrorists by bombing them."

It must be like living in a [Mondrian painting](http://www.allposters.com/gallery.asp?aid=85097&item=325281). Seeing as [Godwin's law](http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/g/Godwin_s_Law.html) has already been violated here, let me just point, first, to the famously demoralizing effects of [the Blitz](http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/timeline/london-blitz.htm) on Londoners; and, second, to the fact that the likes of Al Qaeda would happily settle for *our* deaths, too. The gut reaction of that London attorney is, frankly, the reason we're the good guys. Anyway, [Matt](http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/001880.html#001880) explains, in a form adapted to the meanest capacity, the real-world difficulties of killing all the terrorists without (a) killing other people as you go or (b) creating more terrorists.
