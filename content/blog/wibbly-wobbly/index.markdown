Zell ['I am a Democrat because we are the party of hope'](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3600710.stm) Miller says John Kerry has been [more wrong, more weak and more wobbly than any other national figure](http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/politics/9557575.htm). Except maybe that guy who delivered Clinton's keynote a decade or so ago and is delivering Bush's now. What's his name again?

Miller could have used some bits of the [Bush Twins Speech](http://www.slate.com/id/2106067/) to better effect than they did. "And as to my fifty year career in the Democratic Party â€¦ Well, when I was young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible!" Would've played much better.

Anyway, all in all a ringing endorsement of the the cardinal conservative virtues of steadfastness, loyalty, constancy and, in the words of [another well-known Democrat](http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_08_29_dish_archive.html#109409968493733425) a "partisan," "crude" and "gob-smackingly vile" effort "jammed with bald lies, straw men, and hateful rhetoric." Vote for Bush because *Zell Miller* told you Kerry flip-flops and we shouldn't [change horses in midstream](http://www.buzzflash.com/filmfan/04/08/fil04002.html).
