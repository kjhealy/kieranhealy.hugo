[Pavarotti Loves Elephants. By Joel Veitch.](http://www.rathergood.com/elephants/ "Pavarotti Loves Elephants. By Joel Veitch, rathergood.com") A funny [mondegreen](http://www.rulefortytwo.com/mondegreens.htm). It's turning into Odd Word Day around here this morning. I promise to get back to work now. (But as my friend [Bethany Bryson](http://www.people.virginia.edu/~bb3v/bloopers.html) found out, mondegreens show up in research, too.)
