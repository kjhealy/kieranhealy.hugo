Tina Fetner [waxes Toquevillian](http://brokengoalie.typepad.com/kickasswomen/current_affairs/index.html) about her participation in the Iowa Caucuses:

> Well, I did it. I participated in the glorious process that is the Iowa Caucus. It was my first time, and I was so excited about this down-home version of participatory democracy. What a pile of crap it turned out to be.
