The U.S. [got schooled](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/sports/AP-SOC-WCup-World-Cup.html) by the Czechs. The Times says that Dubya gave the team a call beforehand:

> Eager to prove they are among soccer's elite after their surprising quarterfinal finish in South Korea four years ago, the Americans brought their most-talented team ever to this year's tournament. They even got a pregame pep talk from President Bush, who called from Camp David before the game and wished them well.

Today's result shows diplomatic good wishes won't do it, so that leaves the other two standard policy tools for strategic foreign intervention. First choice would be a large foreign aid package. Seeing as Italy is the U.S.'s next opponent bribery stands a very good chance of working. Something to bail out [Juventus](http://www.google.com/search?q=juventus+scandal), for instance. Failing that, it's airstrikes on Turin.
