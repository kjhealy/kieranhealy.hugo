I don't know when "conferencing" became a verb, but I guess I'm doing it all the same. I'm at the [ASA Meetings](http://www.asanet.org/convention/2004/) in San Francisco, where the keynote speakers include well-known sociologist Paul Krugman. I'm off to the Economic Sociology Section reception soon, but I am nevertheless tempted by the Section on Alcohol Drugs and Tobacco reception. Meanwhile, the [storm damage in Florida](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/15/national/15STOR.final.html?hp) reminds me of the answer to [the stupidest question in the world](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/000538.html).
