![A new villain is born](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/roryhat.jpg)

Superhero blogging is the province of [other members](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/) of this collective. But here—via [Dan Myers](http://monster-blue.blogspot.com/2007/09/theres-new-sheriff-in-town.html), outgoing chair of the Notre Dame sociology department—is Rory McVeigh, incoming chair of said department, welcoming new grad students to the program. Dan [explains](http://monster-blue.blogspot.com/2007/09/theres-new-sheriff-in-town.html) the hat in coldly rational terms. But I prefer to think we're witnessing the birth of a new Supervillain: Doc Socc, whose origin story begins with the mild-mannered but brilliant young Rory being continually passed over when it was time to choose teams in grade school, and who subsequently used his genius to develop the FootieTron (pictured), a prosthetic attachment that enhanced his football skills a millionfold. But once he tried it on, an accidental burst of gamma radiation made the device meld with his brain and now Doc Socc is on a quest to make THE WORLD play soccer FOREVER in teams of HIS choosing. Muaahahahahahaha. Special powers: tactical planning, team organization, long throw, kills enemies from a distance with deadly-accurate soccerbomb passes, close up by hacking expertly at their ankles. Noted ability: when captured, convincingly feigns mortal injury (writhes on ground clutching leg or head) to generate diversion and/or sympathy. Then escapes.
