Alan Keyes [said today](http://www.nbc5.com/politics/3712293/detail.html) that "Christ would not vote for Barack Obama," apparently because Obama is pro-choice. But clearly the reason that Jesus would not vote for Obama is that there is just no way He would move from California to Illinois in the first place.
