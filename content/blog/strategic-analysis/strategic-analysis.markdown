While you munch on your [freedom fries](http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/03/11/sprj.irq.fries/), consider what is going on inside the mind of [Steven DenBeste](http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2003/03/Itsthewaiting.shtml "USS Clueless - It's the waiting"). Here he is wondering about the French:

> De facto they're allied with Saddam even if there's no publicly-declared treaty or agreement; so will they be willing to intervene militarily? Will they smuggle some sort of weaponry in? Or ship it in openly?

> If 20 cargo jets take off from French territory and head towards the middle east, what will we do? If they ignore all attempts to prevent them from reaching Iraq, would we be willing to actually shoot one or more of them down?

> Just how far are they willing to take their opposition to us? They've reached the point where it seems as if they're willing to make any sacrifice. Do they see the stakes as being high enough so that they might actually threaten to nuke us?

Wow. It just boggles the mind. Do you think DenBeste is a *sui generis* fruitcake or does he represent a wide body of opinion?
