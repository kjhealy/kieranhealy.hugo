I've been on the road for the last week or so, gradually making my way by tramp steamer to Australia. By coincidence, I was on [ABC](http://www.abc.net.au) radio's [Background Briefing](http://www.abc.net.au/rn/backgroundbriefing/stories/2006/1740584.htm) programme on Sunday, talking about gift and market exchange in the world of human organ and tissue procurement. There's a [podcast of the show](http://www.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/feeds/bbg_20060917.mp3) available if you want to listen. The topic is easy to treat in a glib or sensationalistic way, but I thought Ian Walker (who wrote and presented the show) did a really good job with it. There's a lot of good first-hand material from organ and tissue donors, recipients and bankers, alongside stuff from me, [Virginia Postrel](http://www.vpostrel.com/weblog/) and others.
