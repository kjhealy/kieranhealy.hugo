[Patrick Nielsen Hayden](http://nielsenhayden.com/electrolite/archives/002398.html#002398) and [Mark Kleiman](http://markarkleiman.blogspot.com/2003_03_01_markarkleiman_archive.html#90413987) are both outraged at the [free pass](http://www.msnbc.com/news/879531.asp?0sl=-12&cp1=1) Saudi Arabia is getting from the U.S. government for both religious persecution and human rights abuses more generally. Meanwhile, President Bush tells reporters ['I'm reading the Bible every day'](http://www.timesreporter.com/left.php?ID=17179). Mark nails the issue, noting that "Foreign workers get tossed into stinking prisons for practicing the faith our President so ostentatiously claims to shareâ€”I think the technical term for his behavior is 'praying in the streetcorners, to be seen of men'".

I'm reminded of a poem by [Oliver Goldsmith](http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/goldsmith001.html) that I learned at school.
 
 bq. **Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog**

> Good people all, of every sort,
>  Give ear unto my song;
>  And if you find it wondrous short,
>  It cannot hold you long.

> In Islington there lived a man,
>  Of whom the world might say
>  That still a godly race he ran,
>  Whene'er he went to pray.

> A kind and gentle heart he had,
>  To comfort friends and foes;
>  The naked every day he clad,
>  When he put on his clothes.

> And in that town a dog was found,
>  As many dogs there be,
>  Both mongrel, puppy, whelp and hound,
>  And curs of low degree.

> This dog and man at first were friends;
>  But when a pique began,
>  The dog, to gain some private ends,
>  Went mad and bit the man.

> Around from all the neighbouring streets
>  The wondering neighbours ran,
>  And swore the dog had lost his wits,
>  To bite so good a man.

> The wound it seemed both sore and sad
>  To every Christian eye;
>  And while they swore the dog was mad,
>  They swore the man would die.

> But soon a wonder came to light,
>  That showed the rogues they lied:
>  The man recovered of the bite,
>  The dog it was that died.
