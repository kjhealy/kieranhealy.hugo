[Anger Management Course](http://www.weblog.nohair.net/current/) looks like a good blog. Its tag line is, "Remember, you don't have to react to everything", which seems like good advice for bloggers everywhere. Choice items include [Florida's new voting machine](http://www.weblog.nohair.net/archives/000067.html#000067) and an excellent [table summarizing the differences](http://www.weblog.nohair.net/archives/000066.html#000066) between hysterical news coverage and the actual facts in the Florida "terrorism" non-event. (Non-event, that is, except for the three students involved.)
