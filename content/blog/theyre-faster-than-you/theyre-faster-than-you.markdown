By all accounts not any sort of couch potato, Ogged is [understandably distressed](http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2007_05_20.html#006859) to look at the age-group records for his chosen event, the 50 meters freestyle, and find that he has to go all the way up to the 75-79 age group to find a time he would stand a chance of beating.

I have the related experience of having family members who are irritatingly athletic. For instance, my brother was on the Irish cross-country team and won a bunch of stuff in college. My sister-in-law ran the Chicago marathon in 2004—her first—and finished seventeenth. Worst of all, two years before I was even born my uncle won a marathon in [Kaduna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaduna) in a time of 2:15:03, then the fastest time ever run in Africa, and now more than thirty five years later still one of the the 20 fastest marathons ever run by any Irishman. (And also, [to my knowledge,](http://www.arrs.net/AC_Mara.htm) still the fastest marathon ever run in Nigeria.)

Elite athletes are different from you and me, and this is true even when, as in my case, you share a significant percentage of their genes. My sister-in-law once told me of the experience—common amongst top women athletes—of being out for a run and getting held up at a stop light. Some regular semi-fit guy out for his evening jog runs up alongside, and glances over. The light changes, and the guy takes off at an unsustainable speed because, obviously, it would be a violation of natural law for a woman to be able to run faster than a guy. Having gone through this one too many times, my sister-in-law adopted the strategy of just tucking in behind the guy and waiting to see what would happen. After a short while he realizes she's behind him. He tries to go faster. He glances behind. She's still there. A very short while later the guy, now beginning to boil in a self-made vat of lactic acid, starts making random turns down streets in a desperate effort to shake his pursuer. It doesn't work. Eventually the guy grinds to a halt, she breezes by, he's left gasping for air and maybe reflecting on his views on gender.
