Can someone in the UK confirm the accuracy of [this report](http://www.sundayherald.com/40592)? (Via [Jim Henley](http://www.highclearing.com/archivesuo/week_2004_03_14.html#005165).)

> WHAT do you give someone who's been proved innocent after spending the best part of their life behind bars, wrongfully convicted of a crime they didn't commit? An apology, maybe? Counselling? Champagne? Compensation? Well, if you're David Blunkett, the Labour Home Secretary, the choice is simple: you give them a big, fat bill for the cost of board and lodgings for the time they spent freeloading at Her Majesty's Pleasure in British prisons.

> On Tuesday, Blunkett will fight in the Royal Courts of Justice in London for the right to charge victims of miscarriages of justice more than £3000 for every year they spent in jail while wrongly convicted … spokesmen in the Home Office say it's a completely "reasonable course of action" as the innocent men and women would have spent the money anyway on food and lodgings if they weren't in prison. The government deems the claw-back 'Saved Living Expenses'.

Is this a step in the calculation of compensation money prior to paying it to the victims, or an attempt to grab some of that money back after the fact? (Is that distinction even relevant?) The *sang froid* of the British Legal Establishment never ceases to amaze. Maybe they could take it out of [Lord Denning's](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~mponeill/law/utilitarianism.html) estate. He [said](http://www.highclearing.com/archivesuo/week_2004_03_14.html#005165) he wanted to be remembered in good works.
