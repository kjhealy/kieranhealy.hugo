[Inside Higher Ed](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/05/09/report) reports that some people got together and [went through](http://www.freeexchangeoncampus.org/index.php?option=com_docman&Itemid=25) David Horowitz's book *The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America* looking for errors. They found a bunch, of course, but by far the funniest one was the discovery that "While Horowitz's book promises a list of the 101 most dangerous academics, he actually includes only 100." The report says "that's because he included at least two and possibly three professors in his introduction." This stuff writes itself.

*Update*: Post edited to make it clear that the "that's because â€¦" quote was from the news report, and not Horowitz himself. (The report seems to be paraphrasing a response from Horowitz, though.)
