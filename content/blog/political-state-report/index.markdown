[Kos](http://www.dailykos.com)'s brainchild, the [Political State Report](http://www.polstate.com/ "Political State Report: straight from the trenches") is up and running. They have two contributors from Arizona, [Dustin Nolte](http://wilde.poetweb.net) (D) and David DodenhoffÂ®. Expect plenty of material on the appalling budget crisis that Arizona has dug its way into.
