A minor classic from a recent [New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com) article about the Augusta National golf club:

> Burk is headquartered in a small room on the tenth floor of an aging Washington office building; she is not paid by the council, and her only full-time paid employee is a pleasant young woman with a nose ring named Rebecca, who sits at the front desk.

Never mind about the nose ringâ€”- what's the young woman's name?
