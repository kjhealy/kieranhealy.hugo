London and many other places will [observe two minutes of silence](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4679681.stm) at noon GMT today for the victims of last week's bombings. The debate has already begun ([see below](http://crookedtimber.org/2005/07/14/battle-lines/)) about the right political and legal response to the attacks. Besides policy and law, though, Britain and Ireland have suffered long enough from terrorism to have produced literature about it. Below I reproduce a powerful poem from the late [James Simmons](http://www.wwnorton.com/nael/20century/topic_4/simmons.htm). It commemorates one of the earliest, and worst, atrocities of the Northern Ireland conflict, the IRA bombing of Claudy town in July of 1972. The circumstances of that event were different from last week's attacks, but some things were the same. I don't know of anything else that conveys them nearly as well.

> **Claudy**

> *for Harry Barton, a song*

The Sperrins surround it, the Faughan flows by
 At each end of Main Street the hills and the sky
 The small town of Claudy at ease in the sun
 Last July in the morning, a new day begun.

How peaceful and pretty, if the moment could stop
 McIlhenny is straightening things in his shop
 His wife is outside serving petrol and then
 A child takes a cloth to a big window-pane

And McCloskey is taking the weight off his feet
 McClelland and Miller are sweeping the street
 Delivering milk at the Beaufort Hotel
 Young Temple's enjoying his first job quite well

And Mrs. McLaughlin is scrubbing her floor
 Artie Hone's crossing the street to a door
 Mrs. Brown, looking around for her cat
 Goes off up an entry, what's strange about that?

Not much, but before she comes back to the road
 The strange car parked outside her house will explode
 And all of the people I've mentioned outside
 Will be waiting to die, or already have died

An explosion too loud for your eardrums to bear
 Young children squealing like pigs in the square
 All faces chalk-white or streaked with bright red
 And the glass, and the dust, and the terrible dead

For an old lady's legs are blown off, and the head
 Of a man's hanging open, and still he's not dead
 He is shrieking for mercy while his son stands and stares
 And stares, and then suddenly – quick – disappears

And Christ, little Katherine Aiken is dead
 Mrs. McLaughlin is pierced through the head
 Meanwhile to Dungiven the killers have gone
 And they're finding it hard to get through on the phone.
