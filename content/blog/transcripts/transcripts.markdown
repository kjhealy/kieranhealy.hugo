Eugene Volokh [notices an error](http://volokh.com/2004_02_08_volokh_archive.html#107637664194722535) in a transcript. My friend [Bethany](http://www.people.virginia.edu/~bb3v/) had a bunch of interviews transcribed professionally for her dissertation and now offers [Transcription Bloopers: 29 Reasons Not to Waste Your Money.](http://www.people.virginia.edu/~bb3v/bloopers.html) Choice examples include:

table(fig). {font-weight:bold;center}\_|As Spoken|As Transcribed|
 |(. 20th century |((. Planting some tree |
 |(. Class oppression |((. Fast depression |
 |(. Enrich each other |((. Rate each other |
 |(. Serbian oral epic |((. Servient oral ethic |

Errors of this sort in transcripts are at the intersection of [Mondegreens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen) and the strange phenomenon of the media always happening to desperately misreport stories you know something about personally.
