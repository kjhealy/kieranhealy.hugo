As always, the choices are limited to maudlin, drunk, and maudlin drunk. I choose drunk.


 **Rounds**
 Carol Ann Duffy

Eight pints
 of lager, please,
 and, of draught Guinness, nine;
 two glasses of pale ale—a squeeze
 of lemon in that port—a dry white wine,
 four rums, three G-and-T's, a vodka—that's the lot.
 On second thoughts, you'd better give me one more double scotch.

A half
 of scrumpy here,
 and over there a stout.
 I think we're ready for more beer;
 ten brandies, three martinis—no, my shout!
 A triple advocaat with lemonade and lime
 and six Bacardis—make that twelve, I've just noticed the time.

Six calves
 of Harlsberg—fast—
 pine bitter shandies—tents—
 and make the landies barge; a vast
 treasure of mipple X, ten meme de crenthes,
 nine muddy blaries and, of winger gine, a wealth.
 Got that? And then the rame again all sound and one yourself.
