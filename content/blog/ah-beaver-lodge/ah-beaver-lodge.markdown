After [Pavarotti and his elephants](http://www.rathergood.com/elephants/) yesterday, Brad DeLong finds himself in [Beaver Lodge](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/archives/001255.html) today. Those [mondegreens](http://www.rulefortytwo.com/mondegreens.htm) are [everywhere](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen). Now excuse me while I [kiss this guy](http://www.duntemann.com/scuseme.htm).
