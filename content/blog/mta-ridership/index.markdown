Here's a Figure of the Day. The [MTA](https://mta.info), and especially the Subway, moves a *lot* of people every day. They also make daily ridership data available. The lines here are weekly averages, either of daily ridership or traffic volume through toll booths. 

{{% figure src="mta_volumes.png" alt="MTA Volume" caption="More people ride the Subway every day on average than lived in the country I grew up in." %}}

_Update:_ I redrew this to use [epiweeks](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/week.html) rather than weeks, so as not to generate artificially large dips in the final week of the year.
