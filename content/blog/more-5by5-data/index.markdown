Thanks to a link from [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/), the [Talk Radio](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2012/07/17/talk-radio/) post got a lot of traffic. Following up on some twitter and email requests, here is some additional stuff. First, the data again, but with [The Incomparable](http://5by5.tv/incomparable/) added:

And finally, for those interested, there's [a github repo with the data and R code](https://github.com/kjhealy/5by5-figures). Enjoy.
