Dan Drezner quotes Clive James to good effect on [snarky literary reviews](http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/000712.html). James is the author of the poem "[The Book of my Enemy has been Remaindered](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jpd/remaindered.html)," which captures the quintessence of literary *schadenfreude* that we get a whiff of when reading snarky reviews:

> The book of my enemy has been remaindered
>  And I am pleased.
>  In vast quantities it has been remaindered
>  Like a van-load of counterfeit that has been seized
>  And sits in piles in a police warehouse,
>  My enemy's much-prized effort sits in piles
>  In the kind of bookshop where remaindering occurs.
>  Great, square stacks of rejected books and, between them, aisles
>  One passes down reflecting on life's vanities,
>  Pausing to remember all those thoughtful reviews
>  Lavished to no avail upon one's enemy's bookâ€”For behold, here is that book
>  Among these ranks and banks of duds,
>  These ponderous and seemingly irreducible cairns
>  Of complete stiffs.
