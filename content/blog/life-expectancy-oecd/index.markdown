The visualization exercise of the day for class is a re-creation of a figure I first saw [Lane Kenworthy](https://lanekenworthy.net) make. It's a connected scatterplot of total health spending in real terms and life expectancy of the population as a whole. The fact that real spending and expectancy tend to steadily increase for most countries in most years makes the year-to-year connections work even though they're not labeled as such.
