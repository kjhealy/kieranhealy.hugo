[Ignatz](http://sheldman.blogspot.com/2002_12_01_sheldman_archive.html#85941759 "Ignatz") couldn't believe that he heard Pat Buchanan [really say](http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=29975) that Trent Lott was getting lynched. But [Atrios](http://atrios.blogspot.com/2002_12_08_atrios_archive.html#90050404) has the quote, and a reminder of what a lynching really looks like. I read somewhere yesterday that phase 3 of the spin cycle on Lott's remarks would be to argue that the Liberals were the real bigots. And here you have itâ€”- just appalling.
