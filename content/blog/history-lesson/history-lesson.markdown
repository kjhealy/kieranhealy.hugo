While you're waiting for him to finish his [monster post](http://volokh.blogspot.com/2003_04_13_volokh_archive.html#200147523) on political theory and political philosophy (see my [short version](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000289.html)â€”two extra disciplines provided for free!) you can see Jacob Levy deliver a [much-needed smacking around](http://volokh.blogspot.com/2003_04_13_volokh_archive.html#200145529) to an article by an [NRO-nothing](http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-eibner041403.asp). Very satisfying.
