Mild-mannered [Professor of History](http://history.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Rauchway_Eric) by day, Eric Rauchway emerges at ~~night~~ other times of the day in an altogether different guise.

![Eric Rauchway](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/rauchwayheadshot.jpg)![Rauchfish](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/rauchwayswims.jpg)

He's going to swim a mile for charity (presumably in just a few seconds, and while wholly underwater). You can go ahead and [donate some money](https://wsdvps2.wsdsecure.com/~wcrc.org/swimmers/profile/203) to his cause. Comments are open on the topic of the Rauchfish's origin story, his unique powers, his faithful sidekick, and the special properties of his suit.
