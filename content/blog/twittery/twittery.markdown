As you may know, [Stephen Fry](http://twitter.com/stephenfry), [John Cleese](http://twitter.com/JohnCleese), [The Cassini Probe](http://twitter.com/CassiniSaturn), [Britney Spears](http://twitter.com/britneyspears), [Shaq](http://twitter.com/THE_REAL_SHAQ), [10 Downing St](http://twitter.com/DowningStreet) and, more tenuously, [Darth Vader](http://twitter.com/darthvader) and [the Fucking Pope](http://twitter.com/thefuckingpope) are all on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/). But who is responsible for [crookedtimber](http://twitter.com/crookedtimber)? Not me. The fact that the one person CT follows is a blocked account makes me suspicious.

By the way, if you neither like nor understand Twitter, that's perfectly OK: no-one is making you follow anyone.
