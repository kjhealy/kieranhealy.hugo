Any society that can make *both* John Tyler Bonner's [The Ideas of Biology](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486424197/kieranhealysw-20/) and [The Evolution of Complexity](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691084947/kieranhealysw-20/) available to me for two dollars each on sale has to have something going for it. On the other hand, Kevin Trudeau's [Natural Cures 'They' don't want you to now about](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0975599518/kieranhealysw-20/) still cost eighteen bucks, and rather more copies of it were available.
