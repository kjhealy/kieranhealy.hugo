Kevin Drum is [exactly right](http://www.calpundit.com/archives/001242.html) about [this piece of crap](http://theweeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/002/681xnmqz.asp) from David Skinner. Kevin's post reminded me of [this Keith Knight cartoon](http://archive.salon.com/comics/knig/2002/03/27/knig/index.html) which makes the same point about reaction to Halle Berry and Denzel Washington at the Oscars.
