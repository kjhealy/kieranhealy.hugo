Here's a St Patrick's day weekend/ blogging/ media convergence. Stephen McKinley's [this story in the Irish Echo](http://www.irishecho.com/search/searchstory.cfm?id=12892&issueid=298 "Irish Echo Online - News") is all about blogging. I get quoted, along with MIck Fealty of [Slugger O'Toole](http://www.sluggerotoole.com). They didn't spell my name properly, alas, but I suppose that's the price of fame.
