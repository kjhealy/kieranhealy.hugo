Some [good stuff](http://www.agonist.org/ "The Agonist--by Sean Paul Kelley") over at The Agonist about the likelihood of messy urban warfare. Sean-Paul Kelly is skeptical of those who take the General Melchett "[barren featureless desert](http://www.whatalovelywar.co.uk/Desert.wav)" view of combat in Iraq. Read the comments, too.
