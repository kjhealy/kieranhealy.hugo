The IRA issued a [statement](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/northern_ireland/newsid_2132000/2132113.stm) today [apologizing to civilian victims](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/northern_ireland/newsid_2132000/2132102.stm) of those killed on Bloody Friday, one of the earliest, and worst, atrocities of the Northern Ireland conflict. It happened on July 21st 1972. Ten days later, the IRA bombed Claudy, a quiet border town. The poet [James Simmons](http://scripts.ireland.com/search/highlight.plx?TextRes=simmons&Path=/newspaper/obituaries/2001/0630/obi1.htm) wrote the "Ballad of Claudy" about that event. It is one of the best pieces of literature to come out of the Troubles. Here it is:

> The Sperrins surround it, the Faughan flows by<br />
>  At each end of Main Street the hills and the sky<br />
>  The small town of Claudy at ease in the sun<br />
>  Last July in the morning, a new day begun.<br />
><br />
> How peaceful and pretty, if the moment could stop<br />
>  McIlhenny is straightening things in his shop<br />
>  His wife is outside serving petrol and then<br />
>  A child takes a cloth to a big window-pane<br />
><br />
> And McCloskey is taking the weight off his feet<br />
>  McClelland and Miller are sweeping the street<br />
>  Delivering milk at the Beaufort Hotel<br />
>  Young Temple's enjoying his first job quite well<br />
><br />
> And Mrs. McLaughlin is scrubbing her floor<br />
>  Artie Hone's crossing the street to a door<br />
>  Mrs. Brown, looking around for her cat<br />
>  Goes off up an entry, what's strange about that?<br />
><br />
> Not much, but before she comes back to the road<br />
>  The strange car parked outside her house will explode<br />
>  And all of the people I've mentioned outside<br />
>  Will be waiting to die, or already have died<br />
><br />
> An explosion too loud for your eardrums to bear<br />
>  Young children squealing like pigs in the square<br />
>  All faces chalk-white or streaked with bright red<br />
>  And the glass, and the dust, and the terrible dead<br />
><br />
> For an old lady's legs are blown off, and the head<br />
>  Of a man's hanging open, and still he's not dead<br />
>  He is shrieking for mercy while his son stands and stares<br />
>  And stares, and then suddenly – quick – disappears<br />
><br />
> And Christ, little Katherine Aiken is dead<br />
>  Mrs. McLaughlin is pierced through the head<br />
>  Meanwhile to Dungiven the killers have gone<br />
>  And they're finding it hard to get through on the phone.
