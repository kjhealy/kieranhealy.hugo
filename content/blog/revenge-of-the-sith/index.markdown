[Tyler Cowen](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/05/revenge_of_the_.html) is excitedly looking forward to *Revenge of the Sith*, and is encouraged by [positive review](http://www.variety.com/VE1117927015.html) in *Variety*:

> The Force returns with most of its original power regained in "Star Wars: Episode III —Revenge of the Sith." Concluding entry in George Lucas second three-pack of space epics teems with action, drama and spectacle, and even supplies the odd surge of emotion … Whatever one thought of the previous two installments, this dynamic picture irons out most of the problems, and emerges as the best in the overall series since "The Empire Strikes Back." Stratospheric B.O. is a given.

Not up to speed on Variety's entertainment-industry jargon, my first thought on reading that last sentence was, "Well of course, what with all those nerds packed in to the cinema."

George Lucas's relationship with his fans must by now be a standard case study for second-year social worker students specializing in the treatment of abusive, co-dependent relationships:

> *Fans* (to therapist): I love him, and, and, I *know* he's really wonderful deep down—I know he means well and is a decent man. It's just that sometimes … (sobbing)
>
> (Cut to videotape)
>
> *Lucas*: Take this, you stupid bitch! [*Offscreen*: Smack! Ewoks! Crash! Jar-Jar! Bang! Big parade/award ceremony at end!]
>
> *Fans* (crying openly): It's my fault, I know—I just can't seem to please him. He doesn't *mean* to hurt this way …

It's awful, really.
