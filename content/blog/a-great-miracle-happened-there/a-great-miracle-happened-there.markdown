It's that time of the year again: the [King William College General Knowledge Paper](http://www.kwc.sch.im/gkp.html) has arrived. It's the kind of quiz that exists at a point just (or far) beyond the production possibility frontier of a space defined by your fondness for crossword-puzzles and your stock of cultural capital. If previous years are anything to go by it's designed to be google-proof, but you're in with a shot if you can guess the theme that unites all the questions in each section. Have at it. (The Great Miracle, incidentally, is scoring more than, say, 20 points.)
