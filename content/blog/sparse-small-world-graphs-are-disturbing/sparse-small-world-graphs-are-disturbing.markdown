1. [Read](http://crookedtimber.org/2007/07/11/trying-not-to-lose-face/) Henry's post on Facebook. Signed up out of curiosity and masochistic desire to have smallness of social network confirmed.
 2. Joined the University of Arizona network. Noodling around, saw the profile for Joe Grad Student from my department. Looked at his list of friends.
 3. Noticed that one of Joe Grad Student's friends looked familiar. Realized I knew him. He had been a year ahead of me in Secondary School in Ireland in the late 1980s. Jaysus.
