I'm trying to remember the source of a quote, and the quote itself—roughly, it says "Individualism is a transitional stage between two kinds of social structure." It sounds like something [Simmel](http://socio.ch/sim/index_sim.htm) would say, or maybe [Amos Hawley](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226319849/kieranhealysw-20/ref=nosim/). Libertarianism has always seemed to me to depend for its realization on features of the social structure that it officially repuditates. It wouldn't be the first ideology of which that was true. But I'm not going to defend that idea here. All I want to say is that I think we'd all be better off if [Jim Henley](http://www.highclearing.com/archivesuo/week_2004_02_22.html#005104) got the kind of traffic that Glenn Reynolds gets, and maybe [Julian Sanchez](http://www.juliansanchez.com/notes.html) got [Virginia Postrel's](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004_archives/000339.html) job at the *Times*.
