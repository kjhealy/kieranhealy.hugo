A number of bloggers have commented on the Simpsons' [parody of Fox News](http://atrios.blogspot.com/2003_03_09_atrios_archive.html#90430382) this weekend ([Your voice for evil](http://www.mwo1.com/krustygop.ram)). Almost unbelievably, this morning I got an email from Fox News (it was also distributed to many of my colleagues). It read:

    Hello -
    The O'Reilly Factor is looking for
    a sociologist with a conservative view
    regarding media and sexuality.  This
    would be for a television interview
    this Friday (3/14).  If there is someone
    within the university who might be available,
    please contact me at 212.301.[xxxx].

    Best,

    [Name withheld]
    FOX News Channel
    1211 Avenue of the Americas
    17th Floor
    New York, NY  10036

Should I sign up? I am a sociologist. I'm not an expert in media studies or the sociology of sexuality, but who cares? It's O'Reilly. So maybe I should go on as a plant. What do you think?
