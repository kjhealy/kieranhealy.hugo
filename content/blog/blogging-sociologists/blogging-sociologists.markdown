The ranks of scholar-bloggers are filled with lawyers, historians, economists and political scientists, but sociologists are thin on the ground. I didn't know of any besides myself and [Eszter](http://www.esztersblog.com) until this week, when I found [Amitai Etzioni](http://www.amitai-notes.com/blog/ "Amitai Etzioni Notes")'s new blog. He's a considerably more influential sociologist than me. As it happens, this week I also got a complementary copy of Issue 1 of the [Socio-Economic Review](http://www3.oup.co.uk/jnls/list/soceco/scope/), a new journal put out by the [Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics](http://www.sase.org/homepage.html).
