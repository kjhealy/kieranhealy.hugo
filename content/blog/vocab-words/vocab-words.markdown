Ted [asks](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/001129.html):

> [O'Reilly has repeatedly lied](http://www.spinsanity.org/post.html?2004_01_04_archive.html#107370065984707346) about the interview in which he told Jeremy Glick to "shut up" and cut off his microphone. As it turns out, transcripts can be checked on this intergummy thing. Someone should make up a phrase about that.

I propose that Bill is here speaking a dialect we shall call **reverse transcriptese**.
