[Milton Friedman has died](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6156106.stm) at the ripe old age of ninety four. Alex Tabarrok at Marginal Revolution [writes a brief appreciation](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/11/milton_friedman_1.html) from the point of view of a fan. As [Harry said](http://crookedtimber.org/2006/11/10/adam-swifts-political-philosophy-an-beginners-guide-for-students-and-politicians/) around here only the other day, everyone should read [Capitalism and Freedom](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226264211/ref=nosim/kieranhealysw-20) at least once.
