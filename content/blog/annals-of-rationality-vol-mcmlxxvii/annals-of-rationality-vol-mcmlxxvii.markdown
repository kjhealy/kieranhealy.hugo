Via [Jeremy Freese](http://jeremyfreese.blogspot.com/2006/11/why-get-help-when-you-can-help-science.html), a poster for a Mass General Hospital study. As Jeremy says,

> Do you have not one, but two separate problems that are associated with making bad decisions? If so, why don't you choose to have a 50% chance of forgoing treatment for both for three months, in exchange for *$600*?... Don't worry: you can rest assured you'll be in the most capable, professional handsâ€”just look at the quality of our graphic design! Yes, that's a picture of a human brain we got off the web, with a martini glass superimposed on top of it. And, see, there's a photo of an anguished woman, just below a photo of a cartoon man so excited he's raising his arms with glee.

This reminds me of one of my favorite books, encountered during research for [Last Best Gifts](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?creative=374929&camp=211189&link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0226322378): Ed Brassard's [Body For Sale: An Inside Look At Medical Research, Drug Testing, And Organ Transplants And How You Can Profit From Them](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0873648587/ref=nosim/). This is a how-to guide for selling the renewable and non-renewable bits of yourself and also for getting accepted into paying clinical trials of all kinds.
