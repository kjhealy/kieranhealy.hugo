[Alan](http://www.schussman.com), a former student and co-author of mine (and recent graduate, congrats Alan), goes hiking in [Black Canyon National Park](http://www.nps.gov/blca/) and reminds me how spectacular the American West is. Sheer canyon walls with [crazy rock climbers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/belay/544579199/in/set-72157600350091740/), fly-fishing for [rainbow trout](http://www.flickr.com/photos/belay/550006617/in/set-72157600350091740/) and [terrific views](http://www.flickr.com/photos/belay/548660116/in/set-72157600350091740/) along the way.
