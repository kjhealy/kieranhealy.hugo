Nicholas Kristof has an Op-Ed piece [about organ sales](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/12/opinion/12KRIS.html "Psst! Sell Your Kidney?") in the Times today. Exchange in human blood and organs is a subject near and dear to my, uh, heart. I wrote my dissertation about it. I have to go teach a class in five minutes, but if you have time to waste you can read a draft paper of mine called [Sacred Markets and Secular Ritual in the Organ Transplant Industry](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/files/drafts/insurance-pton.pdf) that's relevant to Kristof's piece.

Op-Eds like this are *really good* for an Assistant Professor's anxiety level, by the way. Must finish my book faster! Must finish my book faster! Argh. It's about half-way revised at the moment.
