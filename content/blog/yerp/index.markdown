[Matthew Yglesias](http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/001240.html#001240 "Matthew Yglesias") is right to point out that the American media "when presenting "European" opinion, [has] a tendency to ignore the fact that there are a whole bunch of different countries in Europe." This happens all the time. Conservatives love to bash Europe as decadent, weak and helpless without U.S. protection. Liberals sigh and pine for "socialized medicine" and other bits of the welfare state.

My favorite example of this comes from the blurb on the back of packets of Pepperidge Farm Milano Cookies, which begins "Imagine strolling down the cobbled streets to your favorite European bake shop…" Indeed. If only it continued "As you converse with the owner in fluent European…"

Of course, it happens the other way, too: I once had a friend tell me he "didn't like America", speaking as if it was about comparable in size and homogeneity to County Galway or something.
