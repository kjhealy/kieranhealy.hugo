1. Brian Weatherson has a [long post](http://philosophyweblog.blogspot.com/2003_07_01_philosophyweblog_archive.html#105736762683013389 "Thoughts Arguments and Rants") about "[The Context of Essence](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul/papers/new-essentialism-AJP.pdf)," a recent paper of [Laurie's](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul/). Never let it be said that this blog doesn't promote high-quality work in analytic metaphysics, especially when it's written by my wife.

2. Although I've never met Brian, we will soon be posting on the same blog. It's a joint venture by a group of like-minded bloggers and will be launched in the next few days. Stay tuned for details.
