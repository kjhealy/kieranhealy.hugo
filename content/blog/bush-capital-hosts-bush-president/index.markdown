Dubya [joined me in Canberra last night](http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s973244.htm) (in a manner of speaking), but I have yet to see this [obvious](http://www.nla.gov.au/history/content/bushcap1.html) headline used in any newspapers. Security is tight. F-18s are buzzing overhead. I'm used to that from living in the flight path of [Davis-Monthan AFB](http://www.dm.af.mil/default.htm) back in Tucson. There, sorties go out several times a day to further harrass the prickly pears on the [Barry M. Goldwater Bombing Range](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/goldwater.htm) out in the southwestern part of the state, flying over [my department](http://fp.arizona.edu/soc/) on the way. Low-flying [A-10](http://www.a-10.org/)s really bring the concept of "[air superiority](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/408122.stm)" home.

Back in Canberra, we were walking around [Lake Burley Griffin](http://www.australia.travelmall.com/travelmall/attraction/Canberra%20(ACT)/Lake%20Burley%20Griffin) yesterday evening and saw a boat of navy frogmen inspecting the underside of the Commonwealth Avenue bridge, presumably looking for explosives, as Bush's motorcade would have had to drive over it to get to [Parliament House](http://www.aph.gov.au/) and the U.S. embassy. Personally, I'd be more worried that his drivers would get lost on Canberra's carefully planned road system which consists of elegantly [interlocking giant roundabouts](http://www.geocities.com/humehwy31/aug3.html), some of which are inside other even larger roundabouts.
