It's not quite "McArthur Flies Back to Front," but it shares something with "Headless Body in Topless Bar" and I just read it in the current issue of the [ANU's "On Campus" newsletter](http://info.anu.edu.au/mac/Newsletters_and_Journals/On_Campus/_2003/OCJuly2003.pdf) [pdf]:

> **Former Head of John XXIII Remembered**

The headline writer had room to clarify the meaning by inserting the word "College" between "XXIII" and "Remembered" but clearly did not want to spoil her chance to enliven one of the world's duller publications.

This reminds me of the time on Ireland's Nine O'Clock News when newsreader Ann Doyle asked someone whether they would best remember the late Cardinal Tomas O'Fiach as a man or a [primate](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate+of+All+Ireland).
