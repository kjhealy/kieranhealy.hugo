Hit and Run, the new blog by the people at [Reason](http://www.reason.com) magazine, [comment](http://www.reason.com/hitandrun/000299.shtml#000299 "Hit & Run: Roasting D'Souza")
 on George Packer's [skewering](http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20021230&s=packer) of Dinesh D'Souza's *Letters to a Young Conservative*:

> Packer's critique is mostly successful, though some of his arguments would be more credible coming from a conservative than from a liberal.

I think this means "It would make me feel better if Packer's criticisms had come from someone on my side of the ideological fence because, you know, he's basically right." Just close your eyes and swallow the [cod liver oil](http://www.foodreference.com/html/fcodliveroil.html), guys. It's good for you.

(Were American children made to drink cod liver oil? Probably not, the lucky sods.)
