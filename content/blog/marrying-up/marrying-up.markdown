Over at Volokh, recent addition [Jim Lindgren](http://www.law.nwu.edu/faculty/fulltime/Lindgren/Lindgren.html) is making me regret once more their loss of Jacob Levy. [Here he is](http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2004_10_14.shtml#1097728719) complaining about the supposedly appalling moderator bias that caused Bush to lose last night's debate (again):

> Given Theresa ("no blood for oil") Heinz Kerry, the only hard question John Kerry got all night was "I'd like to ask each of you, what is the most important thing you've learned from these strong women?"—and Kerry got to listen to Bush's answer first. UPDATE: — OK, so Kerry should have answered the question about what he learned from his strong wife in this way (I'm recylcing a joke I heard last spring): [What KERRY might have said]: I developed my economic plan for the country from interacting with both my wives. Now I just need to find a rich country for the US to marry.

Clearly, Jim feels that whereas marrying into money is unseemly, being born into it is evidence of one's good judgment. Is the parallel lesson that the US can spend the next 40 years drinking, partying and wasting Dad's money on incompetent schemes, but still have things work out great?
