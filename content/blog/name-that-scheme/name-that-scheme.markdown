You sometimes see a rhetorical device were the author compares himself (or another) to some related group of people, real or fictional, and says that while one might have hoped to be *x*, it turns out one is actually *y*. So, for example, here's one inspired by reading [Untold Stories](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374281033/ref=nosim/) the other night. "When I was younger I hoped I might be [Peter Cook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cook), or even [Jonathan Miller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Miller), but then I discovered I was really [Alan Bennett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Bennett)." As can be seen from this example, there is usually a strong element of faux-modest self-promotion in the apparent putdown, at least when the author is the subject of the comparison. When there is some other target, this scheme is a vehicle for insult. In these cases, the comparison individuals will be related not by a substantive tie but only by name.
