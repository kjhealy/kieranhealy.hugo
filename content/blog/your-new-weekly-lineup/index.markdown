[Dan Drezner](http://drezner.blogspot.com/2003_06_01_drezner_archive.html#95288127) sez:

> Op-ed space on the New York Times is a scarce commodity. Even if it has a liberal bias, I want to read smart liberals—[Josh Marshall](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com), [Kevin Drum](http://www.calpundit.com), [Kieran Healy](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog), [Brad DeLong](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/), [Henry Farrell](http://www.henryfarrell.net/blog)—not pompous windbags like Rosenthal.

Sounds like a great Monday-to-Friday line up to me, Dan. You can have Safire's spot, and the sooner the better. My credentials as a columnist stretch back beyond this blog to happy days at the [Daily Princetonian](http://www.dailyprincetonian.com) writing pieces designed to irritate the undergrads. (This turned out to be absurdly easy. See examples [here](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/columns/crusade.html), [here](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/columns/clones.html), and [here](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/columns/cottage.html).) So I think I could make a go of it, even if the *Times*' audience didn't take to me right away: I got my end-of-semester evaluations back today, and as my favorite one of them said, "He was pretty rude at the beginning but he kind of grew on me like a fungus."
