Until this afternoon, a [Google search](http://www.google.com/search?q=valentine+poem&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) for the phrase ['Valentine Poem'](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000281.html) promptly returned [this elegaic masterpiece](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000281.html) high on the first page of results. (I know this because its been the most popular search referrer to my [website](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog) for each of the past ten days.) Written last year by one of the leading poetic talents of his generation, I think it's a lot better than the crap it got displaced byâ€”but whoever said [democracy](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/001306.html) makes the best choices?
