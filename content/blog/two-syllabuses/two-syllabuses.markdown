In Spring a young man's fancy turns to love. Rapidly aging academics such as myself, however, have to decide which readings to assign. This semester I'm teaching [Organizations and Management](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/teaching/organizations.pdf) to students in Duke's [MMS certificate program](http://www.markets.duke.edu/) and [Markets and Moral Order](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/teaching/ethics200.pdf) to a small group of seniors at the [Kenan Institute for Ethics](http://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/). Both classes were a lot of fun last year (perhaps not for the students). I've rearranged the running order in the Orgs course a bit, as the flow was wrong last time.

If you think there's something that absolutely has to be included in either course, I'm open to suggestions. But (I'm looking at you, Teppo) you're not allowed to suggest something without also saying what I should drop in order to include it. Unlike the economy, a syllabus is not the sort of thing that you want to grow aggressively in order that everyone gets more and bigger slices of the whole.
