Thanksgiving is one of America's best ideas. Appropriately it is intimately associated with one of America's worst inventions, the Pumpkin Pie. I say "appropriately" because such antinomies are common in American life. North and South, Red States and Blue States, expensive gourmet coffee and never a spoonful of real cream to put in it what do you mean you only have the kind that sprays out of a can never mind no that's fine. On such foundational tensions is America built. I'm sure Alexis de Toqueville has a line about this somewhere in *Democracy in America*. Something about the Pumpkin containing the Seeds of its own Destruction—no wait, that was Marx in Vol. III of *Theorien über den Wurzelgemüse*. For de Tocqueville, pumpkin pie is the fulcrum of the argument developed in [Book II, Chapter 14](http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/DETOC/ch2_14.htm) of *Democracy in America*, where he shows "How the taste for physical gratifications is united in America to love of freedom and attention to public affairs." A taste for physical gratification that is fed with pumpkin pie is sure to kindle a strong love of freedom (from the obligation to eat any more) and a concomitant commitment to public affairs (especially the effort to ban the thing once and for all).

I admit this may be a minority reading of de Tocqueville, though surely a wholly plausible one of Marx. But a number of figures in pie scholarship may be against me. Although I have not been [able to trace](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=fafblog+pie+blogging&btnG=Search) a specific pumpkin-related discussion by the [best-known](http://fafblog.blogspot.com/) of the world's two leading pie authorities (the [other one](http://www.weebl.jolt.co.uk/pie.htm) is similarly silent on the matter), there is [some evidence](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2004/06/help_us_fafnir_.html) that Fafnir is strongly pro-pumpkin. ("If a pumpkin pie is not a pie, well then I do not want to live in a world with your cold mechanical robot pies!") This is a worry. The pumpkin pie is generally neglected in the social science literature, in my view rightly so. Milton Friedman [once commented](http://www.policyofliberty.net/quotes6.php) that "Most economic fallacies derive … from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie", but the pie's actual substance was left unspecified by him. Neoclassical economics assumed away the pumpkin by fiat, a move that goes back at least as far as Walras. He found that the tatonnement process could not plausibly be completed as long as the [auctioneer](http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/walrasiana.htm) was left with a shitload of pumpkin that he couldn't get off his hands for love or money. It re-entered the philosophical literature in Wittgenstein, who got it from Sraffa, but his solution is unknown—although in 2001 his grave in Cambridge was [found to have a pork pie on top of it](http://myweb.lsbu.ac.uk/~stafflag/ludwigwittgenstein.html) (no, really, it was), and also a [Mr Kipling Cake](http://www.mrkipling.co.uk/about/)—perhaps evidence of efforts at solution via reduction to problems already solved.

At any rate, my plan is to avoid the pumpkin altogether and make an apple crumble instead. I have a lot of things to be thankful for today, and I hope you do as well—and if one of them is the courage to face up to reality and just eat the nutmeg out of the jar this year instead of using pumpkin puree as a substrate for it, so much the better for you.
