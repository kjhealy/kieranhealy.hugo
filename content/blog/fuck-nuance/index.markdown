About nine months ago, my colleague <a href="http://stephenvaisey.com">Steve Vaisey</a> told me he was interested in organizing a session at the American Sociological Association Meetings about the idea of "nuance" in sociological theory, and in particular about how there seemed to be a lot of demand for the stuff. He asked me if I'd be interested in submitting a paper called something like "Against Nuance". I replied that if you were going to do something like that, you should just go ahead and call it "<a href="https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/fuck-nuance.pdf">Fuck Nuance</a>" and be done with it. "OK then", said Steve, "I'll put that down as the title". 

Having inadvertently bound myself to that mast like some accident-prone Ulysses, I presented the paper last week in Chicago. <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/fuck-nuance.pdf">Here's the draft</a>.
