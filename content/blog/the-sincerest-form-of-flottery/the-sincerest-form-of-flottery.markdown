This is [just too funny](http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2007/03/copycatonomics.php). John Lott, having had his lawsuit against Steven Levitt and *Freakonomics* thrown out, has gone and written a [knock-off](http://www.amazon.com/Freedomnomics-Market-Works-Freaky-Theories/dp/1596985062/ref=sr_1_1/102-1543536-0732120?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1175126046&sr=8-1) called—I'm not making this up—*Freedomnomics: Why the Free Market Works and Freaky Theories Don't*. The jacket design is right out of the [David Horowitz playbook](http://crookedtimber.org/2007/03/22/cover-story/), too.

Presumably it's blurbed by Mary Rosh. Now if you'll excuse me I have to get back to the final chapters of my two forthcoming books, *Greedonomics: A rogue trader shoots first* and *Fritonomics: Exploring the hidden side of snack foods*.
