[Kevin Drum is a little worried](http://calpundit.blogspot.com/2003_04_06_calpundit_archive.html#92453568 "CalPundit"):

**Theorem**: In societies with a sufficiently advanced division of labor and a market-based economy, for any *x* there is a whole subgenre of *x* porn.

**Lemma 1**: It's probably available online.

Who said social science doesn't lend itself to general laws? (Umm, I think [I did](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000360.html).) I'm pretty confident of that one, though.

Meanwhile, the [Volokhs](http://volokh.blogspot.com/) and the [OxBloggers](http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2003_04_06_oxblog_archive.html#92439681) have discovered the wonderful world of socially-constructed gender roles, and plan to discuss them further. I am interested to see if they come up with theories that reproduce, in matchbook form, the ideas of people they might ordinarily think of as PoMo/feminist gender theorists.

To pick at random from a *vast* literature, let me recommend [Drag Queens at the 801 Cabaret](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/15524.ctl) by [Leila Rupp](http://www.womst.ucsb.edu/facultystaff/rupp.html) and Verta Taylor, because they gave a talk at my department recently.
