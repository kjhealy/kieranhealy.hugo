Soc Blogger [Jeremy Freese](http://www.jeremyfreese.com/) won this year's [Interactive Fiction Competition](http://ifcomp.org/comp08/results.html), where the goal is to write a text-based puzzle game in the tradition of stuff like [Infocom classics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom). The premise of Jeremy's game, [Violet](http://tinyurl.com/violetif), is summarized by the [*Chronicle of Higher Education*](http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3469/text-based-computer-game-features-graduate-student-as-main-character):

> It's noon and you've still got 1,000 words to type. That might not seem like much, but it's been months since you've last worked on your dissertation and distractions are plentiful. To make matters worse, your girlfriend, Violet, says she's out the door and flying back to Australia if you don't finish the paper by the end of the day.

> What's your next move?

> This is the premise for Violet, a text-based computer game in which a graduate student is the main character. As the student, you must fight through countless distractions and solve a number of puzzles to finish the paper in time to save your relationship. The story is told by Violet, who allows you to examine objects in your office and ask for hints.

Here is [a review](http://jayisgames.com/archives/2008/11/violet.php). Naturally, a sequel must now be in the works. Who should the protagonist be? What situation should they face? Obvious possibilities include a disaffected English professor teaching somewhere in a state beginning and ending a vowel, whose only creative outlet is bitter, overwritten *Chronicle* columns; a busily networking scholar-blogger desperate to finagle an invitation to appear on Bloggingheads.tv; or perhaps the crisis of a senior faculty member whose long history of abusive pseudonymous commenting is suddenly and inadvertently exposed.
