![image](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/cac-cover-small.jpg) New from MIT Press comes [\_Causation and Counterfactuals\_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262532565/kieranhealysw-20/ref=nosim/), an anthology edited by [John Collins](http://collins.philo.columbia.edu/), [Ned Hall](http://web.mit.edu/philos/www/hall.html) and [L.A. Paul](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul). At the [Pacific APA](http://www.apa.udel.edu/apa/divisions/pacific/) meetings, the latter was recently identified, much to her disgust, as "Kieran Healy from Crooked Timber's wife." *Causation and Counterfactuals* presents the best recent work on the [counterfactual analysis of causation](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-counterfactual/), which helps us understand the metaphysical underpinnings of sentences like "If you don't buy it you'll be sorry," "If I hadn't blogged so much my own book would be finished by now," and "If everyone on CT posted a shameless plug simultaneously, who'd be responsible?" The book is also perhaps the only place to read the full, gripping saga of [Billy and Suzy](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=billy+suzy+counterfactual&btnG=Search), a tale of [passion](http://www.mit.edu/~yablo/advert.html), [overdetermination](http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/homepages/ney/overdetermination_and_mental_causation.pdf), [war](http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:DtIwbmQeUTcJ:web.syr.edu/~edhiddle/Hiddleston%20Causal%20Powers%20web.pdf+billy+suzy+war+causation&hl=en), [double prevention](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul/papers/causation-preemption.pdf) and [appalling violence](http://philosophy.wisc.edu/eells/papers/ptprevmay01webver.PDF).
