[Chris Bertram](http://junius.blogspot.com) is done with his [Rousseau book](https://ecommerce.tandf.co.uk/catalogue/DetailedDisplay.asp?ISBN=0415201993&ResourceCentre=ROUTLEDGE&RedirectPage=PerformSearch.asp&curpage=1). Good for him. Meanwhile I am just trying to revise an resubmit an article. The deadline is Friday. Ack. Let me just say that—basic reasonableness of the reviews notwithstanding—it is a *complete pain* to have to rip out and rewrite the entire front end of your paper. Bleah.

While I have 5 minutes before class, let me also draw your attention to [Elizabeth Lane Lawley's weblog](http://www.it.rit.edu/~ell/mamamusings/), which, besides its interesting homegrown content, has a list of academic bloggers worth following up.
