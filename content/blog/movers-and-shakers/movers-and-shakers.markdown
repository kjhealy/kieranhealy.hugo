[John Quiggin](http://mentalspace.ranters.net/quiggin/ "John Quiggin") has moved address. Funny, I'm on his mailing list but not his blogroll. I know I'm not an economist, but I argue I am a "site of interest". Also moving are the [Farrell Siblings](http://www.henryfarrell.net/blog), making the world safe for Political Science and vice versa. (Sorry if I jumped the gun on announcing the move, Henry.) Both John and the Farrells are using [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org) for their blogs, which is good. Henry and Maria need to turn on TrackBack, however.

The title of this entry reminds me of one of my [favorite New Yorker cartoons](http://www.cartoonbank.com/cartoon_closeup.asp?pf_id=42748&dept_id=1001&mscssid=5JMPRESNBXEW9HG82HA251VPGF4T73P3&cartoon=1&s_keywords=movers,shakers&findby=popular&s_artist=&s_id=&s_imageType=&color=&s_fromdate=&s_todate=&NewYorkerOnly=&s_topic=).

In case you're wondering, my current favorite New Yorker cartoon is [this one](http://www.cartoonbank.com/cartoon_closeup.asp?pf_id=43837&dept_id=1001&mscssid=5JMPRESNBXEW9HG82HA251VPGF4T73P3&cartoon=1&s_keywords=meritocracy&findby=popular&s_artist=&s_id=&s_imageType=&color=&s_fromdate=&s_todate=&NewYorkerOnly=&s_topic=). It compactly summarizes fifty years of sociological research on intergenerational social mobility in the stratification systems of the advanced capitalist democracies. I have a T-shirt of it.
