Lots of other people are talking about this already, but who cares. It's too useful not to talk about some more. It's [Amazon Light](http://www.kokogiak.com/amazon/)â€”- the monster bookstore stripped down to its bare essentials and given a clean, Google-like interface. No more stupid gold boxes! No more busy-busy web pages with a million things happening. Amazon should pay some money to [the designers](http://www.kokogiak.com/default.asp) of this thing.

I wonder what [elegant hack](http://www.eleganthack.com) thinks about it.
