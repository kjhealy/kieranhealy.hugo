A [transcript](http://world-o-crap.com/blog/?p=42) from World O'Crap, with Tim Russert and panelists Michelle Malkin, Ann Coulter, Satan ("Call me Bob") and Jesus Christ. A taste:

> **Russert**: Mr. Christ, what do you say to accusations that you're opposed to fighting a battle to bring about the end of all life on Earth because you're an Anti-Semite?
>
> **Jesus**: Well, first of all, I'd like to point out that I myself am Jewishâ€”
>
> **Ann Coulter**: Yeah! Just like George Soros. Another Jew who somehow figured out a way to avoid crucifixion.
>
> **Jesus**: I WAS crucified! (DISPLAYS WOUNDS IN HANDS)
>
> **Michelle Malkin**: Why don't people ask him more specific questions about the nails in his hands and feet? There are legitimate questions about whether or not they were self-inflicted wounds.
>
> **Russert**: What do you mean self-inflicted? Are you suggesting Mr. Christ crucified himself on purpose?
>
> **Michelle Malkin**: Did you read the book by Barabbas and the Golgotha Veterans for Truth? Some of the thieves who were actually crucified have made allegations that these were self-inflicted wounds.
>
> **Jesus**: I did not NAIL MYSELF to the cross!
