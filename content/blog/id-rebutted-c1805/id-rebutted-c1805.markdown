An episode of *[Blackadder](http://www.blackadderhall.co.uk/)* I just watched makes a point relevant to [recent discussion](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/001236.html) on the plausibility of alternatives to the theory of evolution:

> Blackadder [to Baldrick]: If I don't come up with an idea soon, in the morning we'll both go to meet our maker. In my case, God; in your case, God knowsâ€”but I doubt he's won any design awards.
