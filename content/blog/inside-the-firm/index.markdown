[Brad DeLong](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/archives/001473.html) notes Sony's internal conflicts over licensing and copy protection. The consumer electronics division sees the world differently from the entertainment division. This is a good example of why it's not right to think, as [Brink Lindsey](http://www.brinklindsey.com/archives/001415.php#001415) does, that a Coasian picture of markets and firms accurately describes the social organization of the economy. Firms are not simply dictatorships established as the result of a transactions cost calculation. I wrote about this at slightly greater length a while ago, [here](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/blog/archives/000067.html#000067) and [here](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/blog/archives/000069.html).
