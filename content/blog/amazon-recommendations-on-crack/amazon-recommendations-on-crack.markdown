[Amazon's](http://www.amazon.com) front page just recommended that I buy Ayn Rand's [*Atlas Shrugged*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451191145). Looks like a severe bug has crept into the recommendation sofware. Normally their suggestions are pretty good, considering that I usually buy only quite specialized social science stuff. And, [militant supporters](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/business_basics/newsid_178000/178569.stm) notwithstanding, the Ice Queen of Objectivism does not show up in this context very often.

Atlas Shrugged's [entry](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451191145) on Amazon has more than 800 comments. A good one near the top reads "**Longest Book I Ever Read**" [Five Stars].
