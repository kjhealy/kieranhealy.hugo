The [ASA](http://asanet.org/)'s Annual Conference is this weekend. I'm flying in from Sydney, so if I see you there and don't recognize you, or fall asleep at your talk, or forget my own name, then please accept my apologies in advance. This year it's being held at [Caesars Palace, Las Vegas](http://www.caesarspalace.com/), which may be the most exciting thing to happen to professional sociology since [Ulysses G. Weatherly](http://www2.asanet.org/governance/weatherly.html) took [Edward A. Ross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_A._Ross%20) out to a disastrous surprise birthday dinner at a Chinese restaurant in 1899. As the [conference website](http://asanet.org/AM2011/index.cfm) says, "Some of the world's most exciting and versatile entertainers perform here including Celine Dion, Barry Manilow, Jerry Seinfeld, and so many more." Sadly, we are going to miss Cher, Barry Manilow and Rod Stewart by a week or so on either side. It's worth noting that all of these exciting and versatile entertainers are about the same age as ASA headliner [Randy Collins](http://sociology.sas.upenn.edu/r_collins), give or take three or four years. Unlike them, Randy writes all his own material.

Here, then, is your card. You can [click for a larger version](https://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/asabingo2011.png). Feel free to toot your Bingo progress on the Twitter using this custom-made [\#ASA2011](https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/#ASA2011) hashtag. Remember, there are BIG PRIZES to be won, especially if you shout out "BINGO!" in the middle of a plenary session.[1]

fn1. There are no big prizes to be won. I take no responsibility whatsoever for any professional or personal consequences stemming from shouting out "BINGO" in the middle of a plenary session.
