Now that Ireland have been knocked out of the World Cup (a tragedy, but never mind), I've had to figure out what else to do besides watch the game when I **get up much too early**. Catching up on backlogged work is, alas, the obvious choice.

I just finished a first draft of a paper called "[What's New for Culture in the New Economy?" [pdf]](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/files/drafts/culture-newecon.pdf). It's a review rather than a research article, which **made it hard to write**. Writing reviews can be quite boring, particularly if you don't have any big axes to grind. Anyway, the paper looks at the recent wave of stuff that's come out on the creative industries and creativity generally, against the background of the "new economy". (Scare quotes optional.) I wrote it for the Summer Cultural Policy Meetingsâ€”- a small conference, full of interesting people, that will happen in July.

Feel free to send me **lots of constructive comments**.
