Since my [earlier post about it](http://crookedtimber.org/2005/10/18/same-sex-marriage/), Maggie Gallagher's guest appearance at the Volokh Conspiracy has taken a [rapid](http://www.volokh.com/archives/archive_2005_10_16-2005_10_22.shtml#1129776523) [turn](http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&url=http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2005_10_16-2005_10_22.shtml#1129775642) for the [worse](http://www.volokh.com/archives/archive_2005_10_16-2005_10_22.shtml#1129756529). She keeps putting up scattershot posts that resolutely fail to engage with any of the reasonable questions and criticisms an increasingly exasperated group of commenters have repeatedly offered her. It irritates the commenters no end that she begins posts with phrases like "Let me clarify" and then doesn't clear anything up. Gallagher now seems reduced to presenting quotes from sociologists allegedly intent on destroying civilizationâ€”surely the last refuge of a desperate conservative.
