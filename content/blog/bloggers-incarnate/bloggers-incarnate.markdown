Laurie and I had dinner last night with [Kevin Drum](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/) and his wife Marian. Kevin's as engaging as you'd expect from his blog, only taller. Thanks to this dinner, Kevin has now met as many Crooked Timberites (Timberoids? [Timberteers](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/001378.html)?) as I have. I have this image of all the CT members finally gathered around a table for dinner somewhere someday, staring at their starters and sipping their drinks in awkward silence. I hope to increase my network score in the next few days by tracking down Brian, who like me is here for the Pacific APA, except he's a real philosopher whereas I'm only married to one. As it happens, I did accidentally have a job interview at the Eastern APA a few years back, when I sat at the wrong table in one of the ballrooms. Sadly, I made the mistake of admitting that I wasn't the guy they were looking for. I should have stuck it out and tried to get a campus visit out of it.
