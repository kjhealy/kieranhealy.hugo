Listening to the reports about the Miami "Seas of David" alleged terrorist cell, I couldn't help returning to the thought: what did these jackasses really think they were doing? The fact that they were seeking to establish contact with Al Qaeda (rather than being part of that organization from the beginning) was one red flag. The rather mixed bag of plans was another. The odd cultish overtones yet another. [Jim Henley's reading of the indictment](http://highclearing.com/index.php/archives/2006/06/24/5234) suggests further grounds for suspecting that these guys were less evil terrorist geniuses and more greedy idiots.
