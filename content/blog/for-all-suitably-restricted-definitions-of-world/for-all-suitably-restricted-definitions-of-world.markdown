Tim Dunlop [encounters](http://www.roadtosurfdom.com/surfdomarchives/001910.php) U.S. sports commentators at their most excitable:

> Over the last few days I've heard four radio commentators refer to the Superbowl as the "most important sporting event in the world". Those exact words.

This is especially true this year with the eagerly-awaited [Lingerie Bowl](http://www.lingeriebowl.com/main.htm) at half-time. Depending on your outlook, the Lingerie Bowl is either (1) A measure of how deeply the [Title IX](http://www.ed.gov/pubs/TitleIX/index.html) revolution in women's athletics has penetrated into the football industry, (2) A high-end version of the noble American tradition of [powder puff football](http://www.davidson.k12.nc.us/ledford/ppfoota.htm); or (3) Sadly available only on Pay-Per-View.

Anyway, the most important sporting event in the world is the [All Ireland Hurling Final](http://www.rte.ie/news/1999/0912/gaa.html).
