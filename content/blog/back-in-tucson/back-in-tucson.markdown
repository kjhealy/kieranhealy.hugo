I'm back in town, with about 20lbs extra luggage weight in books, mostly bought at a very good bookshop in Fairhaven, WA. So much for restraint. The ASA meetings are next week, too, and I haven't even gotten around to some of the books I bought there *last* year. Sporadic book reports may follow, assuming I don't just stack them on my shelf.
