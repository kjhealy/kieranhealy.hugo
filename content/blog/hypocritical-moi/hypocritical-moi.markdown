Evidence of a new [irregular verb](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/000536.html) courtesy of an interview with [Roberta Combs](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/16/magazine/16QUESTIONS.html), president of the Christian Coalition of America, full-time Washington lobbyist and mother:

> *Would you like to see American products like television shows flourish in Baghdad as well?*
>
> Oh, no. I hope they don't show ''The Osbournes'' over there â€¦ Shows like that wouldn't exist if mothers stayed home with their kids and supervised what they watched.
>
> *But you yourself are a working mother. Do you think you could have been happy as a full-time housewife?*
>
> Probably not. Probably it would not have been enough for me. I always had a desire to make a difference. That is why I love the legislative process, where you can make a difference.

Thus we have,

> I am out there making a difference;
>  You should really be at home with the kids;
>  She is undermining the moral foundations of our society.

Such double standards are nothing new in the world of [Ladies Against Women](http://www.well.com/user/gail/ladies/), of course, but the barefaced cheek of it is still irritating.
