But not for me. David Bernstein [today](http://volokh.com/2003_11_09_volokh_archive.html#106857816254083358):

> EGREGIOUS MISUSE OF THE LEGACY OF NAZISM:

> Yes, the Nazis were at war, and the United States is now at war. ... What all this has to do with a "supremacist ideology" in today's U.S. is beyond me, and I'm sure beyond Soros as well. Just goes to show that the fact that someone is a brilliant businessman and philanthropist doesn't mean he always exhibits common sense.

David Bernstein [yesterday](http://volokh.com/2003_11_09_volokh_archive.html#106843767837011188):

> But my ultimate concern is that the radical Left would like to bring to society as a whole the kind of authoritarianism they are constantly trying to, and sometimes succeeding in, bringing to universities … [their] ultimate goal, to be achieved through "harassment" law, hate speech rules, and changes in First Amendment jurisprudence, is to have the government enforce PCism throughout society. ... By 2003, Robert Martin, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Western Ontario, commented that he increasingly thinks that "Canada now is a totalitarian theocracy."

Just goes to show that [fill in the blank yourself]. [On mature recollection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lenihan), Bernstein has edited his post to tone down—I mean, clarify—its more wild-eyed bits, in response to [several](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/000804.html) [critical](http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/001789.html#001789) [comments](http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/001339.shtml#001339).
