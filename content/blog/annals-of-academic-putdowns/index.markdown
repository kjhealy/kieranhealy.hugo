[An article about new books on Robert Oppenheimer](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/21/books/21masl.html?ex=1271736000&en=2a34a86231a33e36&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) quotes the following zinger:

> "American Prometheus" does capture the world in which Oppenheimer established his credentials: thick with future Nobelists, bristling with innovation, cattily competitive. (As one of his fellow scholars remarked about another: "So young and already so unknown.")

That one's up there with "This book fills a needed gap in the literature."
