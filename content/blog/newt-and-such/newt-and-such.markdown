Kevin Drum [succinctly describes](http://www.calpundit.com/archives/001036.html) the arc of Newt Gingrich's career. Very oddly, I can remember the first time I read his name, because I didn't understand that it *was* a name. It was during the summer holidays in 1986 and I had just bought a copy of *Check your Egos at the Door*, a Doonesbury book made up mainly of strips from 1984 and '85. I didn't understand a lot of the references. (Give me a break: I was 13 years old.) In one sequence, Rick laments Reagan's landslide victory over Mondale, comes home drunk and has [this exchange with his wife Joanie](http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/dailydose/index.cfm?uc_full_date=19841201&uc_daction=X).

> R: What if it wasn't just a triumph of personality Joanie? What if it's a **real** revolution? What if one day my kid wakes up in a country run by **Newt Gingrich**?

> J: By a what?

> R: Newt Gingrich.

> J: Sounds like a creature from "Dune."

Now that I come to think of it, I remember the funniest thing about the book was a story involving a surgeon's efforts to transplant the heart of a liberal into the body of a conservative. The results [weren't pretty](http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/dailydose/index.cfm?uc_full_date=19850221&uc_daction=X). Much of my time these days is spent writing a book about the social organization of organ donation. Perhaps Duke's [unorthodox perspective](http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/dailydose/index.cfm?uc_full_date=19850119&uc_daction=X) on donor sourcing was what got me started down that road.
