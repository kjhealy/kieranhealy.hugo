David Adesnik [doesn't believe](http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2003_06_08_oxblog_archive.html#95528571) there's much in the way of Iraqi resistance outside the "Sunni Triangle." [Tacitus disagrees](http://38.144.96.23/tacitus/archives/000866.html#000866) and gives a list of U.S. fatalities. David [rebuts him](http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2003_08_24_oxblog_archive.html#106196792513976923), saying

> Tacitus most definitely has a good eye for detail, but are ten or so fatalities supposed to persuade me that there is real resistance outside the Sunni Triangle?

Well, it'd probably convince the hell out of me if I'd been one of the soldiers killed. Except it wouldn't matter, because I'd be dead.

This is kind of a cheap riposte from me, and the two may have already [resolved their differences](http://38.144.96.23/tacitus/archives/000868.html#000868) about the substantive issue. But it's worth policing the armchair generalship if only because tossing around phrases like "Are ten or so fatalities supposed to persuade me" is not a good habit for a responsible Oxblogger to have. It's a bit like that *Economist* article that Daniel [picked on recently](http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2003_06_08_d-squareddigest_archive.html#95587037) for casually making a distinction between hunger and "mere uncertainty about where the next meal was coming from."
