![Simpsons Kieran](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/khsimp.png) [Simpsonize yourself](http://www.simpsonizeme.com/index.php) by uploading a headshot, providing a few variables, and (allegedly) having it automatically converted. You can tweak the image afterwards. [JamesJoyner](http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2007/07/simpsonize_me_is_very_lame/) thinks it's lame. Here I amâ€”I'll leave the veridicality of the representation for others to judge. The site is a bit finicky, perhaps because it's overloaded with users. If you get it to work, post a link to yourself in the comments.
