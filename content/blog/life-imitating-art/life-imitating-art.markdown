[Rep Sam Johnson](http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/003628.html "R - Texas"), the other day:

> Speaking at a veterans' celebration at Suncreek United Methodist Church in Allen, Texasâ€¦.Johnson said he told the president that night, "Syria is the problem. Syria is where those weapons of mass destruction are, in my view. You know, I can fly an F-15, put two nukes on 'em and I'll make one pass. We won't have to worry about Syria anymore."

[Randy Newman](http://laeren.zoggins.net/music/lyrics/lyrics-politicalscience.php), some years ago:

> No one likes us
>  I don't know why
>  We may not be perfect
>  But heaven knows we try
>  But all around even our old friends put us down
>  Let's drop the big one and see what happens
>
> We give them money
>  But are they grateful?
>  No they're spiteful
>  And they're hateful
>  They don't respect us, so let's surprise them
>  We'll drop the big one and pulverize them.

Maybe the GOP should hire Newman as a foreign policy consultant. Johnson's decision to deliver the remarks in a church was a particularly nice touch. I wonder if he knows where the road to Damascus actually is.
