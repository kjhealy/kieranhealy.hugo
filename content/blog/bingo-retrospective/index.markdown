ASA Conference Bingo is on a permanent vacation pending its return around 2030 in a nostalgic comeback that warms the hearts of fans old and new. But as several people have asked me about it, here is a collection of the cards from years past. Not available in stores.

## 2008
Back in 2008, the groundbreaking first ASA Conference Bingo was so new and radical, it [required instructions to play](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2008/07/30/play-along/).

## 2009
The difficult Second Bingo was presented with [no such concessions](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2009/08/05/asa-bingo-2009/) but subtly higher production values.

## 2010
The notorious "lost Bingo" of 2010 was a rougher cut, distributed without a marketing campaign and available only briefly on Twitter before it disappeared to a parish  hall in a small town in remote upstate New York to figure things out for a while.

## 2011
This year's Bingo was originally Chicago Bingo, but popular demand prompted a last-minute move to Las Vegas and a corresponding redesign.

## 2012
The final Bingo appeared in 2012, with an [accompanying essay](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2012/08/13/bingo-in-utopia/) emphasizing Bingo's deep roots in social theory, to complement the "Real Utopias" theme of the meeting. I believe this was the year that Bingo was criticized by some Very Serious People for its alleged cynicism about Twitter and QR codes, which was (I promise I am not making this up) explained by the alleged hostility of older faculty to the democratizing power of social media.
