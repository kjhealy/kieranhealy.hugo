I know I speak as a Mac user and thus by definition in thrall to the Steve Jobs RDF —though I am not in the market for a phone right now—but looking at [these new commercials](http://www.apple.com/iphone/ads/), it does seem as though the iPhone is going to be a license for Apple to print money. When was the last time you saw a cellphone ad that just went through some of the things the phone could do? And what phone on the market does these things in remotely as integrated and elegant a fashion? It seems like the main unknown is the physical stuff: will it scratch, will the screen get greasy, and all that.
