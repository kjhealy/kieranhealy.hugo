So, the World Cup's most famous precognitive German cephalopod, Paul, has predicted from his tank in Oberhausen that [Spain will beat Holland on Sunday](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jul/09/psychic-octopus-paul-picks-spain), leading to various death threats, offers of state protection from the Spanish government, and a proliferation of calamari recipes circulating amongst my Dutch friends on FaceBook. All of which means, surely, that it *really is true* that some people are hoping that the [fascist octopus](%20http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=fascist+octopus) has sung its swan song.

I'll get my coat.
