It looks like I was performing a public service when I [recently posted](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000283.html#000283) about how to deal with philosophers, because [Laurie's](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul) co-authored paper on [Causation and Preemption](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul/papers/causation-preemption.pdf) is [certainly](http://philosophyweblog.blogspot.com/2003_02_16_philosophyweblog_archive.html#89277678) getting [lots](http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/002212.html#002212) of [attention](http://calpundit.blogspot.com/2003_02_16_calpundit_archive.html#89276266) from bloggers. Remember to buy the book when it comes out later this year from MIT Press.
