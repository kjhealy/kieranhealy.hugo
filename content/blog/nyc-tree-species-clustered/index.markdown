One more Tree Data figure. I had been messing around with the tree data clustering NTA neighborhoods by tree species and count profiles. But we can also cluster tree species by similarity of neighborhood profiles---that is, by trying to put the species most likely to be found together in neighborhoods close together in clusters. Here's what that looks like, as a circular dendrogram. It is of course pleasing to make a dendrogram that clusters things that have real leaves and branches. The figure is also available [as a PDF file](tree_cluster_by_count.pdf).

_Update:_ While I'm at it, here's the other side of the matrix, with the neighborhoods clustered by tree profile similarity.

The figure is also available [as a PDF file](neighborhood_cluster_by_profile_circular.pdf).
