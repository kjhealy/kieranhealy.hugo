![image](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/voodoo-doll.jpg)Via [Tina at Scatterplot](http://scatter.wordpress.com/2008/05/13/voodoo-for-sociology/), you must buy [Wicked Anomie's](hhttp://wickedanomie.blogspot.com/2008/05/asa-fundraiser.html/) terrific [Blind Reviewer Voodoo Doll](http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=11740353). Designed for those moments when you need more than just a brisk letter to the journal editor explaining that your reviewer is unclear on a few points.

> This 9-inch doll (without hair) is lovingly crafted within the anomie studio and arrives finished and ready to be put to good use. This doll comes unstuffed, so that you can enjoy the cathartic act of shredding your own offending documents and stuffing them inside the doll. Finishing instructions and extra yarn included.

Proceeds go to fund designer's trip to Annual Conference. We are not responsible for any stabbing pains you may experience in light of purchases encouraged by this post.
