First [Sean Carroll gets to go on Colbert](http://crookedtimber.org/2010/03/11/carroll-on-colbert/); and now [Jonathan Dancy](http://web.mac.com/jonathandancy/Site/Welcome.html) does a very creditable job on Craig Ferguson's show. I just want to make it clear to TV producers that I am available for gigs. Now, unlike Jonathan I am not the father of a [well-known actor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Dancy), so I lack a connection to the world of "show business". But, even so, comedy is kind of a hobby of mine. Well, actually, it's a little more than just a hobby. Reader's Digest is considering publishing two of my jokes.
