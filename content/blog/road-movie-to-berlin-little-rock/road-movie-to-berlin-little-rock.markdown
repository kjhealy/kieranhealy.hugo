Hello from a motel in [Little Rock, Arkansas](http://www.littlerock.com/), which turns out to have free ethernet. (The motel, not the city.) Today's route ran from near [Salem, SC](http://www.sciway.net/city/salem.html), up [I-85](http://www.ncroads.com/interst/ih085.htm) to [Spartanburg, SC](http://www.cityofspartanburg.org/) where I picked up [I-26](http://www.ncdot.org/projects/I26Connector/) to [Asheville, NC](http://www.asheville.com/), where you hit [I-40](http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-040.html). The drive across the [Smokies](http://www.nps.gov/grsm/) was beautiful, though there were some brutally heavy rainstorms. Then I drove across the whole of Tennessee, lengthways. The first city was [Knoxville](http://www.knoxville.org/). I swear the smug looking guy in the fancy sportscar who cut me off around there [looked familiar](http://www.instapundit.com). The longer it went on, the flatter and less interesting Tennessee became, and the more I was forced to resort to strategies like singing in the car in order to keep myself awake. Well, to be honest maybe I didn't need that much provocation. Here's [forty seconds' worth of video](http://www.kieranhealy.org/trip/day1.mov) from a day's worth of driving. Tomorrow: On to [Amarillo](http://www.amarillonet.com/)! I wonder if we have any readers in Amarillo.
