James Kellner is the chairman and CEO of [Turner Broadcasting](http://www.turner.com). In a recent [interview](http://www.inside.com/product/product.asp?entity=CableWorld&pf_ID=7A2ACA71-FAAD-41FC-A100-0B8A11C30373), he suggested repeatedly that people who skip TV commercials are violating their contract with TV companies who provide ad-supported programming. He generously conceded that "there's a certain amount of tolerance for going to the bathroom."

While you're wondering where you put that contract you signed with the major broadcast networks, [read some more](http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=198) from the interview and learn about the Top Ten New Copyright Crimes that people like Kellner might have in mind for you. [LawMeme](http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme), incidentally, is a good source for informed commentary on copyright law, information technology and innovation. You can also read [a survey article [pdf]](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/papers/jpp.pdf) of mine on this general topic (with a focus on artistic and cultural goods) that's forthcoming in the [*Journal of Political Philosophy*](http://www.blackwellpublishers.co.uk/journals/JOPP/descript.htm).
