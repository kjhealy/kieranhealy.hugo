Sorry to inflict kid-related anecdotes on you all. However. Scene: Two-year-old sitting in her cot with Teddy and Elmo. She has put a sippy-cup in front of Teddy. Me: "Oh, is Teddy drinking some water?" Pause. Kid: "No." Me: "Why not?" Kid: "Teddy has no mouth." Me: "Ah." Kid: "Elmo has mouth. Elmo drink it."
