[No-one will be fooled](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/04/27/president-obamas-long-form-birth-certificate). I demand the White House release video of Obama being born on home plate during the 1961 World Series, with Roger Maris attending the delivery and being heard to remark "That's a fine-looking future President you have there, Ann". Oh wait, is the White House REFUSING to release this video? Or maybe—just maybe—are they in fact UNABLE TO? And why do you think that would be? Because the so-called President was IN AFRICA at the time? Because Hawaii wasn't even a U.S. Territory in 1961? I think you can join the dots yourself. I rest my case.
