Although it's great that [Ted](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/000919.html) and [Henry](http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/000918.html) get to point out what's wrong with the likes of [Instapundit's take](http://www.instapundit.com/archives/012840.php) on the Plame *Vanity Fair* story, I'd be much more entertained in a world where Wilson was on the side of the Bushies. Because then all this would have to be part of a cunning plan of appalling subtlety, and I expect we'd be hearing—in hushed but confident tones, delivered via anonymous email correspondents—that the [woman in the car](http://slate.msn.com/id/2091907/) was *not Valerie Plame at all*.
