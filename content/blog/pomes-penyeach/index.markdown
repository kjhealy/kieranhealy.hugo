[D-Squared](http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2003_06_15_d-squareddigest_archive.html#95764416) attacks the westernized haiku, the stinger missile of bad poetry. But not all haikus in English are so bad (though they may all not be haikus). Exhibit A is by [John Cooper Clarke](http://www.cyberspike.com/clarke/) and runs [as follows](http://www.cyberspike.com/clarke/haiku.html):

> To-Con-vey one's mood
>  In sev-en-teen syll-able-s
>  is ve-ry dif-fic.

My only foray into verse, written the Summer before last during a period of great personal stress and crisis, can be found [here](http://www.kieranhealy.org/relocate.php3). It also abuses a too-easily imitated metre.

Meanwhile, in a comment to the [previous](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000461.html#000461) post, [Patrick Nielsen Hayden](http://nielsenhayden.com/electrolite/) points out that, according to the AP, the [push to keep the road map on-track has intensified](http://www.kfor.com/Global/story.asp?S=1324909). This form of prose is itself a kind of poetry, one of the highest achievements of western culture in the past fifty years.
