Hey, my referrer logs tell me I'm number 17 on the [Daypop Top 40 Links](http://www.daypop.com/top/ "Daypop Top 40 Links") list. Right up there with Steven Den Beste, but several places behind a CNN story about [Liechtenstein](http://www.daypop.com/redirect?id=22048453) being for rent. Thanks to [Jacob Levy](http://volokh.blogspot.com/2003_02_02_volokh_archive.html#90297255), [Kevin Drum](http://calpundit.blogspot.com/2003_02_02_calpundit_archive.html#88781079) and [Glenn Reynolds](http://www.instapundit.com) for mentioning my move, and to various others for updating their links to me. Update today! You know it makes sense.
