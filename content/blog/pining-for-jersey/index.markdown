[Mark Kleiman](http://markarkleiman.blogspot.com/2002_09_29_markarkleiman_archive.html) summarizes the latest twist in the New Jersey Senate race better than I could. [Josh Marshall](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/oct0201.html#100602137am) also has a good comment on this. Prediction: Coverage of Forrester's embarrassing memo by the right-wing bloggers will be eschewed in favor of more hype about Iraq and unfounded speculation about the terrorist underpinnings of the Montgomery County shootings. And anyone who says that's just a distraction will be haughtily dismissed as a cynic. (And there I was thinking it was conservatives who were supposed to be the hard-nosed realists.) Just a feeling.
