Over at the Guardian Blog, [Daniel looks to see](http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/daniel_davies/2006/04/university_colours.html) what percentage of the 300 "Comment is Free" contributors mentioned in their profile that they went to university, and of those what percentage went to Oxford or Cambridge. Answer: 20 percent mentioned a university, and 85 percent of the time it was Oxford or Cambridge. This reminds me of a line, which you still sometimes see in obituaries or profiles, that goes something like, "Educated at Eton and Oxford, he then [or "also"] attended Harvard." There's also that episode of *Inspector Morse* where the Chancellor, played by John Gielgud, is asked by some toady how many honorary degrees he has. "Oh, fifteen," he says blandly, "Sixteen, if you count Yale."
