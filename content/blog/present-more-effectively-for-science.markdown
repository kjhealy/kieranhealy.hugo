![We've both said a lot of things you're going to regret.](http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/aperture-presentation-sm.jpg)

Because of the [day that's in it](http://www.thinkwithportals.com/), here's a simple [Aperture Science Keynote Theme](http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/ApertureScienceKeynote.zip). The theme requires you have [Univers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univers) installed. For maximum effectiveness, the use of this theme is best accompanied by a well-prepared text, a clear speaking voice, and—for fielding questions—a functional Aperture Science military android. I'll probably use the theme in class tomorrow (though the turret is still being shipped to me). Here are some samples:

 *Title Slides Should Credit Your Supervisor.*

 *Use images to convey pertinent information.*

 *Cake will be served after the Q&A*.

To use the theme, [download the zip file](http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/ApertureScienceKeynote.zip) and unzip it into ` ~/Library/Application Support/iWork/Keynote/Themes/`. If you do not have the Univers typeface installed you will likely get errors about missing resources, but falling back on Helvetica will work OK, too.
