I just finished a writing up a 500-word entry for a forthcoming *Encyclopedia of Economic Sociology*, edited by [Jens Beckert](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691049076/kieranhealysw-20/ref=nosim/%22) and Milan Zafiroski. (I was only about a year late. You'd think the blogging would have made 500-word chunks easy to churn out.) While reading the boilerplate in the contributor's agreement, I came across the following clause:

> 2 (a) ... The Contributor further warrants that the Contribution contains nothing obscene, libellous, **blasphemous**, in breach of copyright or otherwise unlawful …

All well and good, except that my allocated entry is "[Sacred](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/drafts/sacred.pdf)." As you will all remember from your social theory class, [Durkheim](http://www.relst.uiuc.edu/durkheim/)'s view is that religion is a [collective representation](http://home.att.net/~cscavileer/edcollective.html) of the social structure. "Society awakens in us the feeling of the divine." This is not likely to get a [nihil obstat](http://www.hyperdictionary.com/dictionary/nihil+obstat) from many religions.
