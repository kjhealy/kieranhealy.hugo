My periodically-updated guide to [choosing your workflow applications](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/workflow-apps.pdf) has received one of its periodic updates. It has grown an abstract and more up-to-date stuff on backups and versioning. Plus extra jokes. [Click through](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/workflow-apps.pdf) to readâ€”you may have to reload it if you have an old version lurking in your browser cache. This release is officially named "Dime On You Crazy Shriner" in honor of orgtheory's favorite pseudonymously-produced, bot-driven, stylistically-elliptical demisemisocblog.
