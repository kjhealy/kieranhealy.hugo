Amazon has a new feature:

> *Amazon.com Statistically Improbable Phrases*: Amazon.com's Statistically Improbable Phrases, or "SIPs", show you the interesting, distinctive, or unlikely phrases that occur in the text of books in Search Inside the Book. Our computers scan the text of all books in the Search Inside program. If they find a phrase that occurs a large number of times in a particular book relative to how many times it occurs across all Search Inside books, that phrase is a SIP in that book.

Experimenting with this, I find that SIPs effectively convey the essence of an author's ideas, provided that the author is a phrase-maker. Very useful for cocktail parties. Here, by way of example, is the condensed essence of a number of sociological theorists.

You're invited to browse authors in the field of your choice. Some fields are a bit thin on SIP-able texts. *The Wealth of Nations* wasn't that good for phrases, but Keynes' *Essays in Persuasion* yielded "intensifying unemployment, inside opinion, internal price level" while Volume II of Hayek's *Law, Legislation and Liberty* came up with the very nice "catallactic possibilities".
