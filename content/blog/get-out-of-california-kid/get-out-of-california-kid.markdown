So I'm working away here by the pool of the [Hotel Del Sol](http://www.sftravel.com/hotels/htlmarina/hoteldelsol.html) here in San Franciso, and this couple drive up next to me and go to check in. Their three-year-old wanders around, and looks at the pool. His Dad comes out with the keys and says "Hey, isn't that a nice pool?" The kid looks at it. "Where's the hot tub?" he says. "Well, not all pools have hot tubs," Dad replies. They wander off towards their room. "Is this pool open at night?" asks the kid. "I think your standards are too high" says Dad.
