More than Dubya hates Saddam<br />
Or an [Idiotarian](http://nicedoggie.net/) hates a clue<br />
Or [Reynolds](http://www.instapundit.com) hates the A.N.S.W.E.R. icks<br />
That's how much I love you.<br />
<br />
I love you more than a Max can [Speak](http://www.maxspeak.org/gm/)<br />
And more than a [DenBeste](http://home.san.rr.com/denbeste/web%20log/index.html) bores<br />
I love you more than [Denton](http://www.nickdenton.org) smirks<br />
And more than [Caruso](http://www.jaycaruso.com) roars.<br />
<br />
As a [Freeper](http://www.freerepublic.com/) hates a [Camembert slice](http://www.letourdefrance.btinternet.co.uk/cw.html)<br />
And an [OxBlogger](http://oxblog.blogspot.com/) hates a dove<br />
As [CalPundit](http://calpundit.blogspot.com/) hates a rainy day<br />
That's how much you I love.<br />
<br />
I love you more than a [Volokh](http://volokh.blogspot.com) lurks<br />
And more than a [Skippy](http://xnerg.blogspot.com) jumps<br />
More than [Mickey](http://www.kausfiles.com/) likes the inside dope<br />
And more than a [Kos](http://www.dailykos.com) daily stumps.<br />

I swear to you by the stars above,<br />
And below if such there be,<br />
As Lott is loved by [Mary Rosh](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/guns/maryrosh.html)<br />
That's how [you're](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/images/Laurie1.jpg) loved by me.<br />
<br />
<br />(With sincere apologies to [Ogden Nash](http://www.westegg.com/nash/).)
