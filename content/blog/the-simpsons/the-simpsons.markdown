The opening sequence of *The Simpsons*, only [with real people](http://youtube.com/watch?v=49IDp76kjPw). (English people, apparently.) Clever. Is it an amateur effort, or some marketing thing? Pretty damn impressive, if the former. A third, highly likely option is that it's something that's been floating around for a year or five which I only now have discovered.
