I got the proofs of my "[Digital Technology and Cultural Goods](http://fiachra.soc.arizona.edu/files/drafts/jpp.pdf)" paper this weekend. It will appear later this year in the [*Journal of Political Philosophy*](http://www.blackwellpublishers.co.uk/journals/JOPP/descript.htm). Nice to see that some journals now distribute proofs in PDF format: it makes the correction phase faster, as well as making it easier to make a good copy available.
