For a few years in graduate school I wrote a regular column for the [Daily Princetonian](http://www.dailyprincetonian.com), Princeton's main student newspaper. I got into a bit of trouble once or twice over it, notably for a [piece I wrote](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/columns/crusade.html) out of irritation with the local chapter of the [Campus Crusade for Christ](http://www.ccci.org/).

I was reminded of this when I learned, via [Billmon](http://billmon.org), of the [strong Christian beliefs](http://billmon.org/archives/001518.html) of [General Counsel Mary Walker](http://www.pwfsd.org/article.php?sid=238). She led the legal team that wrote the [recently leaked memo](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/08/politics/08ABUS.html?hp) arguing that there were no legal considerations, domestic or foreign, that prevented the President from authorizing torture. She is also a co-founded of the [Professional Women's Fellowship](http://www.pwfsd.org/), an offshoot of the CCC. Philip Carter at [Intel Dump](http://www.intel-dump.com) has described the memo as ['a cookbook approach for illegal government conduct'](http://www.intel-dump.com/archives/archive_2004_06_07.shtml#1086610719). Here is Walker in an [interview](http://www.pwfsd.org/article.php?sid=238) about her beliefs, followed by a snippet of her report:

> **Walker**: "Making moral decisions in the workplace where it is easy to go along and get along takes courage. It takes moral strength and courage to say, 'I'm not going to do this because I don't think it's the right thing to do.'"
>  **The report**: Officials could escape torture convictions by arguing that they were following superior orders, since such orders "may be inferred to be lawful" and are "disobeyed at the peril of the subordinate."

With just a little more effort here, we could push through to the world of [Jack Lint](http://www.trond.com/brazil/images/brazil48.jpg), the character played by Michael Palin in [Brazil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088846/).

**Update**: The Walker interview was yanked from the Professional Women's Fellowship website, in a Christian act of covering up embarrassing stuff. But [Billmon](http://billmon.org/archives/001524.html) has a copy.
