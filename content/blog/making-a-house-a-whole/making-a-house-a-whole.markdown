At present I'm in a part of Ireland where internet access is about as common as sunshine and clear skies. This means I have only belatedly come across Matt Yglesias's [call for technical assistance](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/08/two_become_one.php) from [my wife](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul), in her capacity as a trained professional mereologist, to help resolve the thorny question of whether John McCain's luxury double-condo in Phoenix counts as one house or two. My understanding is that mereological relations are somewhat flexible, and it's quite acceptable for the same material object to be two condos and one home. Nevertheless, I am a mereologist by marriage only, so my views should not be taken as representing the opinions of a trained and licensed professional. I do think that this issue opens up the possibility of a new kind of political philosophy, though.
