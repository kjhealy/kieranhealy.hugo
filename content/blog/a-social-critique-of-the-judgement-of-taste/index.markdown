> [Victoria's secret](http://www2.victoriassecret.com/category/content/OSPNKCLIZZZ.html) recently announced that minnversity-themed t-shirts, hoodies, and underwear will be sold as part of the company's PINK collegiate collection. ... however, the [Minnesota Daily](http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2008/06/18/72167360) reveals that Goldy Gopher [the [UMN mascot](http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=goldy+gopher&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&um=1&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&resnum=1&ct=title)] will not be participating in the new loungewear line â€¦ Spokesgophers made clear that the clothing line is "not in step with the University's values and focus" and that the Minnversity only "approves tasteful trademark requests." ...
