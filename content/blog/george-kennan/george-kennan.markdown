Via Dan Drezner, [news](http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/001949.html) that George Kennan [has died](http://nytimes.com/2005/03/18/politics/18kennan.html?ei=5094&en=46f6dc2ef0963ce8&hp=&ex=1111208400&partner=homepage&pagewanted=all). The [last time](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000334.html) I came across him intervening in public life was in March of 2003 in a [letter to the Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21796-2003Mar24.html). Here it is:

> I am extremely concerned about the shameful, almost total passivity of Congress during the period of preparations for our military attack on Iraq. (I recognize as exceptions Sen. Robert C. Byrd's noble statement in the Senate [In Brief, March 20] and the belated but vigorous statements of Sen. Thomas A. Daschle [news story, March 18].)
>
> Congress's inaction is a dangerous precedent in executive-legislative relations. In light of this precedent, future presidents will be tempted to seize virtually dictatorial powers under the title of commander in chief, and nothing in our history rules out the possibility of their yielding to that temptation. This seems to be the meaning of the recent crisis.
