Business intrudes on blogging. For shame. In the meantime, some random thoughts:

When someone raises the ["meme" meme](http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/002250.html#002250) I am "tempted" meme to "reach" meme for my "crap" meme.

Why has the [Foundation for the Defense of Democracy](http://www.defenddemocracy.org), widely linked to by warbloggers, adopted [this logo](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/iraqidemocracy.html)? Surely it stinks of the [cheese-stained streets](http://www.greatbuildings.com/cgi-bin/gbp.cgi/Statue_of_Liberty.html/138021/MCG/LF49.gbp) where it was made and should be returned to them forthwith, along with a huffy note.

Democracy in Iraq—- great idea. How much will a U.S. invasion contribute to its prospects? Not much, I think.

Apropos of nothing, organizing a wedding is a constrained optimization problem. Variables are: Elegant, Cheap, and Organized by Someone Else. Pick any two.

All of [this brouhaha](http://markarkleiman.blogspot.com/2003_02_01_markarkleiman_archive.html#90336551) about [Megan McArdle](http://www.janegalt.net) getting upset about nasty hate mail in the wake of her throwaway remarks about hitting protesters with 2×4s seems like small beer when [toxic waste like this](http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/002248.html#002248) gets its own TV show.
