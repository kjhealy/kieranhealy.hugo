[CalPundit](http://calpundit.blogspot.com/2002_10_06_calpundit_archive.html#82765232) has an excellent post complaining about [fisking](http://volokh.blogspot.com/2002_08_04_volokh_archive.html#85331300). I agree with him. It's the lamest form of criticism. (It reminds me of what we try to stop graduate students doing in first-year seminars. "This is crap! All crap! Every word of it!") Next on the list, I think, is [anti-idiotarianism](http://www.instapundit.com/archives/004567.php)., which [MaxSpeak](http://maxspeak.org/gm/archives/00000580.html) was complaining about the other day. It's stuff like this that give me blog-fatigue. Fisk, fisk, idiot, idiot. Bleah. After a while, it's like having someone shouting in your ear. It's the kind of approach that leads to a pointlessly angry and sarky public sphereâ€”- not to mention closed minds all around. That's why I like [Anger Management Course's advice](http://www.weblog.nohair.net/current/), and why I laughed at [R. Robot](http://www.inksyndicate.com/warbot/).
