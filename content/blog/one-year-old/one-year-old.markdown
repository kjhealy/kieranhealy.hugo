This blog is one year old today. After a [brilliantly original](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000001.html) first post, followed by a [now-falsified prediction](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000002.html), I finally got around to [something substantive](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000005.html) by the end of my first week. My month-ending statistics for May 2002 say I was rewarded with 26 unique visitors, some of whom were me using different computers. This month I'm on track to get about 22,000 visitorsâ€”certainly nowhere near the traffic of the big fish (how's that for a mixed metaphor?), but pretty respectable [as things go](http://www.truthlaidbear.com/ecosystem.php). I still think it's odd that more people read what's here every week than have ever read any of my [published papers](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kjhealy/papers.php3). Just as long as the senior faculty don't find out, I suppose. At any rate, after a year's worth of posting, I now control the recently-married, expat-Irish social scientist niche in the blogosphere. Except for [Henry Farrell](http://www.henryfarrell.net/blog) of course. Damn.
