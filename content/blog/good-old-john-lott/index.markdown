Don Luskin may be the [stupidest man alive](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2005-3_archives/000216.html), but this is small beer compared to John Lott, whose career strives to maximize a three-variable function defined by stupidity, error and sheer bad faith. Whenever you think there are regions of this space that he could not possibly explore further, [he proves you wrong](http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2006/02/lotts_correction_policy.php).
