> I don't understand why the Bush Administration has been so slow to respond. Nor do I think that high-profile diplomacy, or an invasion, is an appropriate response. We should be responding quietly, killing radical mullahs and iranian atomic scientists, supporting the simmering insurgencies within Iran, putting the mullahs' expat business interests out of business, etc.

The whole [24 outlook on life](http://crookedtimber.org/2007/02/10/takin-care-of-business/) is really catching on. As I've been [saying](http://www.crookedtimber.org/2005/12/19/spying-at-home/) for [years](http://www.crookedtimber.org/2004/12/03/freedom-on-the-march/), secret state-sponsored assassination and torture programs are why I am a libertarian. Plus all the cool military hardware, obviously. Those guys had flat panel screens before anyone. And those little communicator watches, too. I bet they have iPhones already. *Exploding* iPhones. On to Tehran!
