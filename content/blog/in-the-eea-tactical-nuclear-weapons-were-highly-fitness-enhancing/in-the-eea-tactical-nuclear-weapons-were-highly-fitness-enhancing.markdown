For those of you who keep track of [Satoshi Kanazawa](http://www.lse.ac.uk/people/s.kanazawa@lse.ac.uk/)—evolutionary psychologist, co-author of [*Why Beautiful People Have More Daughters*](http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-People-Have-More-Daughters/dp/0399533656/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1205208165&sr=1-1), and [the Fenimore Cooper of Sociobiology](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/02/the_fenimore_co.html)—is now blogging at [Psychology Today Magazine](http://blogs.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200803/why-we-are-losing-war). Let's turn the mike over to him:

> Both World War I and World War II lasted for four years. We fought vast empires with organized armies and navies with tanks, airplanes, and submarines, yet it took us only four years to defeat them. ... World War III, which began on September 11, 2001, has been going on for nearly seven years now, but there is no end in sight. There are no clear signs that we are winning the war, or even leading in the game. ... Why isn't this a slam dunk? It seems to me that there is one resource that our enemies have in abundance but we don't: hate. We don't hate our enemies nearly as much as they hate us. They are consumed in pure and intense hatred of us, while we appear to have PC'ed hatred out of our lexicon and emotional repertoire. We are not even allowed to call our enemies for who they are, and must instead use euphemisms like "terrorists." ... Hatred of enemies has always been a proximate emotional motive for war throughout human evolutionary history. Until now.

> Here's a little thought experiment. Imagine that, on September 11, 2001, when the Twin Towers came down, the President of the United States was not George W. Bush, but Ann Coulter. What would have happened then? On September 12, President Coulter would have ordered the US military forces to drop 35 nuclear bombs throughout the Middle East, killing all of our actual and potential enemy combatants, and their wives and children. On September 13, the war would have been over and won, *without a single American life lost*.

And there you have it.
