Some of you know [my background](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kjhealy/vita.php3). I'm a social scientist [born](http://www.cork-guide.ie/), raised and [educated](http://www.ucc.ie) in Ireland, with a Ph.D from an [American University](http://www.princeton.edu) and currently an [Assistant Professor](http://fp.arizona.edu/soc/) at the University of Arizona, more or less at the southern border of the United States. My [research interests](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kjhealy/papers.php3) are in comparative economic organization, institutions, altruism and volunteering. I have a strong interest in Internet-related research.

Meanwhile, brand-new blogger [Henry Farrell](http://farrell.blogspot.com/ "Henry Farrell's Weblog") is a social scientist [born](http://www.visitdublin.com/), raised and [educated](http://www.ucd.ie) in Ireland, with a Ph.D from an [American University](http://www.georgetown.edu) and currently an [Assistant Professor](http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/polsci/) at the University of Toronto, more or less at the northern border of the United States. His [research interests](http://users.rcn.com/erbnico/work) are in comparative political economy, institutions, trust and cooperation. He has a strong interest in Internet-related research.

Although I've never met Henry, I feel confident that he is also smart, good looking and an all-round great guy. (Based on the other similarities this obviously only stands to reason.)

Henry and I are at the vanguard of a secret invasion force of Irish academics. He'll lead the attack on the heavily-defended Northern front, while I will sweep up through the soft-taco underbelly of the Southwest. This devastating pincer movement will cut the supply lines of the big Midwestern schools and strategically isolate New England (or 'Old America' as it is now known). And don't think we're not keeping a close eye on the [sleeper cells](http://www.atlanticblog.com/) on the home front, either.
