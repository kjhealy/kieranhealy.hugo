I am here in Palo Alto at the [Center for Advanced Study](http://www.casbs.org/), for a Summer ~~Camp~~ Institute, and am drowning in readings on global convergence, divergence and trajectories of global capitalism, while trying to punch above my weight with a bunch of smart people. (World Cup mixed metaphors have infected my writing: not "Not waving but drowning" but "Drowning and Punching". Hmm.) Palo Alto is like Princeton West, only somewhat larger. Fortunately I have no internet access where I'm staying to distract me. Meeting my co-campers has added significantly to the list of books and articles I need to read, let alone write. For instance, there's Len Seabrooke's [The Social Sources of Financial Power](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0801443806/ref=nosim/kieranhealysw-20), Josh Whitford's [The New Old Economy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199286019/ref=nosim/kieranhealysw-20), and Monica Prasad's [The Politics of Free Markets](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226679020/ref=nosim/kieranhealysw-20).

Meanwhile, [Omar Lizardo](http://www.nd.edu/~olizardo/index.html) is [blogging](http://wordpress.com/tag/guest-bloggers/) at [OrgTheory](http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/). Go read him. I'm on Omar's dissertation committee so I take full credit for all the good stuff he says, including the title of this post.
