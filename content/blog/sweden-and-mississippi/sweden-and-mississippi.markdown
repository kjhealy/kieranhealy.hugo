A [silly-sounding claim](http://www.instapundit.com/archives/003508.php#003508) leads to a [slew of responses](http://www.msnbc.com/news/752664.asp) and eventually to a [measured assessment](http://mkpolitics.blogspot.com/2002_09_01_mkpolitics_archive.html#85425390) that's also a brief tutorial on comparative cross-national policy analysis. Thanks to [Junius](http://junius.blogspot.com/) for leading me to [Mark Kleiman](http://markarkleiman.blogspot.com/)'s blog. One to add to the "regular visits" list, I think.
