Via my former RA Brayden King comes news that you can now [Marry Your Pet](http://www.marryyourpet.com/) if you feel that it's, you know, *the one*. Matilda, who has been a "Pet and Partners Priest for longer than she'd care to remember" will marry you and your chosen pet in one of [three sizes of wedding](http://www.marryyourpet.com/examples.php). Many [happily married interspecies couples](http://www.marryyourpet.com/previously.php) testify that it brought added depth and meaning to their lives. It was the [disclaimer](http://www.marryyourpet.com/disclaimer.php) that convinced me the site was on the level. It helpfully points out that although you get a marriage certificate "You have no conjugal rights. **You are not allowed to have sex with your pet**."

If you don't want that kind of relationship with your dog, then perhaps you should consider [sending](http://www.thedogisland.com/sendyourdog.html) it to [Dog Island](http://www.thedogisland.com/), where they may roam freely on one of the three constituent islands (for big, medium and small dogs, as appropriate), and feed on [rabbits raised on wild carrots](http://www.thedogisland.com/FAQ.html).

Incidentally, you may not wed if both you and your pet are gay, as this would desecrate the sanctity of marriage.
