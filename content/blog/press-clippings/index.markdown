Via [Pandagon](http://www.pandagon.net/mtarchives/004936.html), the [Rev. Terry Fox](http://www.ljworld.com/section/gaymarriage/story/201237) of Wichita, KS:

> Fox helped turn defeat of the amendment in the Legislature in 2004 to victory for his side at the polls Tuesday night. The amendment passed by 70 percent to 30 percent. "We never dreamed we would have this margin of victory," he said. Next in his sights, he said, is "keeping an eye on evolution and abortion clinics."

Evolution clinics? Hey, that's not such a bad idea. We could get [P.Z. Myers](http://pharyngula.org/) to run them as a franchise:

> Walk-in: Well *I* think that evolution is just a *theory*.
>  PZ: Step in to this room, please.

Meanwhile, Tad Brennan finds the Washington Post describing the [unusual educational careers](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32379-2005Apr6.html) of Howard Dean supporters:

> More than half (54 percent) hold post-graduate degrees and a quarter have graduated from college.

Tad says that if he'd known you could get a post-graduate degree without graduating college, he'd have saved years of his life.
