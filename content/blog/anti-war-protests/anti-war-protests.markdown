[Glenn Reynolds](http://www.instapundit.com/archives/006825.php#006825 "Instapundit.com:") (safely at one remove, via a correspondent, for purposes of plausible deniability) gives a patronising account of the impressively large [anti-war protests](http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/01/18/sproject.irq.us.protests/index.html) around the country today. (Impressive both for their absolute size and for their size given that there's not actually a war on yet.) Reporting live from the Department of Inadvertent Self-Revelation, his informant writes:

> Finally, I was struck by the attitude of the protestors. "Whiny" and "smug" come to mind, as does "entitled." I know that doesn't cover the territory, but I'm having a hard time finding the right words to describe it. "Condescending" might be better, as in "I'm clearly your moral superior, therefore I'm entitled to dictate the solution."

Um, yeah. Clearly we get no [smugness](http://www.instapundit.com/archives/006826.php#006826), no [whining](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/825242/posts), no [chest-beating moralizing](http://www.andrewsullivan.com), no [insulting condescention](http://atrios.blogspot.com/2003_01_12_atrios_archive.html#90189251) and certainly no [obnoxious sense of entitlement](http://uggabugga.blogspot.com/2003_01_12_uggabugga_archive.html#87590816) from the pro-war side. Nossir. And anyone who says different is an objectively pro-Saddam know-nothing who will receive a Sontag award after a peremptory fisking.
