The first [Sociological Science Conference](https://socsciconf.org) began this
morning. It was organized primarily by my colleague Steve Vaisey, along with Ashley
Harrell, Craig Rawlings, Turgut Kestinturk, Pablo Bello, and myself. We began on a
somber note because of some news that came with the first visitors on Sunday
evening.

_Opening Remarks_

Harrison White passed away the day before yesterday after, I believe, a long
illness. This is not the time for a proper remembrance, and I am not the person
to do it. But we are here for the next two days under the label of [Sociological
Science](https://sociologicalscience.com). Each of us likely has a view about
what that phrase means, and probably disagree on many points. But one part of
science is surely its methods and techniques. And another part is its imagery,
its metaphors, and its vision. There are few sociologists who so fully
embodied the power of technique while also being so gifted with imagery and so
clearly in the grip of a vision of the world. I was looking last night at my
copy of _Identity and Control_ and I was reminded, first, that Chuck Tilly a
little ruefully compared it to _Finnegans Wake_; and then, second, of a thing that
Samuel Beckett said about that book. “Here” he remarked, “words are not the
polite contortions of twentieth century printer’s ink. They are alive. They
elbow their way on to the page, and glow and blaze and fade and disappear.” We
should all be so lucky to have our own scientific work draw flame and catch
fire in the way that Harrison White’s work so often did.

Here's a [short post from 2008](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2008/03/09/figs-from-thistles/) that touches on White's astonishing legacy of training students.
