I spent yesterday evening participating in the [Nightly Observing Program](http://www.noao.edu/outreach/nop/) at the [Kitt Peak National Observatory](http://www.noao.edu/kpno/ "Kitt Peak National Observatory"). Kitt Peak is an 8,000ft mountain on the Tohono O'odham reservation, about sixty miles west of Tucson. The Observatory, part of the [NOAO](http://www.noao.edu/) and run by the National Science Foundation, has more optical telescopes in one place than anywhere else on earth—- almost 25—- as well as a few radio telescopes.

The friendly guys running the program start by teaching you how to read a [planisphere](http://www.starwishing.com/planisphere.html), then you go outside with a good pair of binoculars and get a tour of the sky. Because Kitt Peak is high up, and the light pollution is so low, the views are fantastic. Knowledgeable guides and good observing conditions make a great combination. It's amazing how much you can see. For instance, last night was the first time I really appreciated that the Milky Way is a real object in the sky—- a bluish-gray lane of dust and stars running to the western horizon.

After the binoculars, you get to look through a 16-inch (soon to be 25-inch) telescope in one of the domes. We saw the [dumbell nebula](http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0682.html), the [M15 Globular Cluster](http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0013.html), Andromeda, a binary star system, and a bunch of other stuff. And it wasn't even a perfect night—- there was some high cloud and haze that messed things up a little.

You may have guessed by now that I want to go back. I'd strongly recommend it if you're ever in Southern Arizona and have even the tiniest bit of curiosity about the Universe. You'll end up—- as I obviously did—- feeling like a 10 year old and talking like that section of *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*: "Space, it says, is big—- really big. You won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the street to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space. Listen…"
