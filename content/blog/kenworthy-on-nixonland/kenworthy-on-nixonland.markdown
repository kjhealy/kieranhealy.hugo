My colleague Lane Kenworthy [reviews Rick Perlstein's *Nixonland*](http://lanekenworthy.net/2008/06/17/nixonland-one-two-or-many-americas/), proving in the process that he is a faster reader (and writer) than me.

> Is Perlstein right about what happened during these years? Did America harden into two warring camps? I think an argument can be made that something very different occurred: the developments of the 1960s coupled with (and accentuated by) Nixon's political tactics opened up new fissures that left the political landscape not more crystallized, but more clouded. Instead of shifting from (more or less) one America to two, the shift was, arguably, toward a greater multiplicity of political identities that the two political parties had to struggle mightily to try to shape into manageable coalitions.
