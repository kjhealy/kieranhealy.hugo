So [Laurie](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lapaul), the lucky duck, got a copy of the [Atlas of Creation](http://www.harunyahya.com/books/darwinism/atlas_creation/atlas_creation_01.php), the amazingly large-format, glossy-photo-laden, funtastic creationist slice of life, courtesy of whoever is bankrolling its author [Adnan Oktar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harun_Yahya). It's a fantastic educational resource for our three-year-old: she's already excited about cutting out the photos of the bunnies and fishies, etc, and making them into collages, puppets and so on. Strongly recommended.
