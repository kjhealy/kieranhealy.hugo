Here is [Jürgen Habermas' Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/jhabermas). No, really. One can't quite be sure, of course (maybe a German speaker can point to some coverage of this in the German press?), but it seems on the level. If so (even if it's him via an assistant), that is pretty outstanding, because my ASA Publications Committee slogan can now be "Jürgen Habermas is on Twitter but ASR still requires paper submissions".

*Update*: Looks like I [need a new slogan](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2010/02/habermas-on-twitter.html). Boo.
