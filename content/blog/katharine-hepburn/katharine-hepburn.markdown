If you're one of those people who thinks there are two kinds of people in the world, you might say there are the ones who go in for Audrey Hepburn and the ones who go in for [Katharine Hepburn](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/30/obituaries/30HEPB.html "Katharine Hepburn, Spirited Actress, Dies at 96"). I've always been solidly of the second type, myself.
