I'm teaching graduate social theory again this semester, and I ended up taking a hatchet to the syllabus. [This time round](http://kieranhealy.org/files/teaching/gradtheory.pdf) we're looking at things more thematically than chronologically, because I decided I didn't want to be doing the History of Ideas all the time. Comments, suggestions, incoherent grunting, and bitter laughter at the sad, sad, state of the field are welcome.
