"I am of Ireland / And the Holy Land of Ireland" wrote [W.B. Yeats](http://plagiarist.com/poetry/?wid=3372). It seems that [from now on](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2003_archives/000828.html), whenever I talk about the likes of [Jacob Levy](http://volokh.blogspot.com) or [Dan Drezner](http://drezner.blogspot.com) I will have to say "Jacob Levy of Chicago and the University of Chicago". [William Sjostrom](http://www.atlanticblog.com/archives/000637.html#000637) (of Cork, the National University of Ireland at Cork, and formerly of the University of Chicago) offers the case for the defence, but I think he's backed a losing horse on this one. In fact, the offending sentence has already been changed, without apparent acknowledgement. It [used to read](http://johnquiggin.blogspot.com/2003_02_23_johnquiggin_archive.html#90392433)

Now that I (of Tucson and the [University of Arizona](http://fp.arizona.edu/soc/), and [formerly](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kjhealy/vita.php3) of New Jersey and [Princeton](http://www.princeton.edu/~sociolog) and before that of Cork and the National University of Ireland at Cork, also known as [UCC](http://www.ucc.ie)) think of it, in the world of celebrity academics this distinction could be a useful one. For instance, there are quite a few superstars who are of, say, New York and Princeton University. Or of Harvard University and Tuscany. The best case I've ever heard of is a sociologist who's on the faculty at UCLA but lives in New York. He commutes for three days a week during the semester, I believe.
