Judging from his new photo, it looks as though [CalPundit](http://calpundit.blogspot.com/ "CalPundit") has left his [clean-cut, sunny persona](http://members.cox.net/kdrum/Kevin.jpg) behind and transformed himself into some kind of [Orwellian military leader](http://members.cox.net/kdrum/Blog_Kevin1.jpg). Pretty frightening :) On the other hand, Orange County may finally have found its General McArthur (or possibly Mao Zedong), who will take his place along with other great heroes of Southern California such as [Major General Juan Gomez de los Angeles](http://www.insmogandthunder.com/juan_gomez.html) and [Commander Rebecca Jordan](http://www.insmogandthunder.com/gallery.html).
