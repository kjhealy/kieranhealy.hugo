[Dani Rodrik argues](http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/08/why-do-economis.html) that much disagreement in economics is between "first-best" economists and "second-best" economists. The former take [Mark 1:14-15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%201%20:14-15;&version=9;) as their text, and believe the Kingdom of God is at Hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. The second believe, with [Proverbs 16:18](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2016:18;&version=9;) that pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.
