It's [fifty years](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/3781481.stm) since the death of mathematician, code-breaker and computer pioneer [Alan Turing](http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/index.html). Turing committed suicide after being forced to take estrogen for a year to "cure" him of his homosexuality. I read Andrew Hodges' [excellent biography](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671528092/kieranhealysw-20/ref=nosim/) of Turing when I was in College. I remember Hodges noting that from about 1935 to his death he had a new and basically unprecedented idea about every five or six years. A remarkable character.
