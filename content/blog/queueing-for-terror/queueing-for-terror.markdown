Well, I picked a good day to be taking an international flight. At least I'm not in the UK. Next time I travel, I'll be sure to check to see whether [John has identified any empirical regularities](http://crookedtimber.org/2006/08/09/two-point-scales/) about my mode of transport and act accordingly. This is why economics is the queen of the social sciences.

Here in Tucson's airport, people are pretty good-humored about it all. The TSA staff aren't making any exceptions, though: while in line waiting to be screened, I saw an octogenarian in a wheelchair have her bottle of Chanel tossed in the bin.

I'm off to Montreal for the [American Sociological Association Meetings](http://www.asanet.org), which naturally are being held in Canada this year, as part of an ongoing arrangement whereby the Canadian Sociological Society will meet next year in Australia, and the American Economics Association will have their meetings run by the Indian Society of Chemical Engineers. Be on the lookout for amusing articles in the newspaper picking out papers with embarrassing titles.
