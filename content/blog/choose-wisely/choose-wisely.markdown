Semester's nearly over. Three options.

> (1) Go to office, write final exam and exam key, do other dull-but-important end-of-semester tasks.

> (2) Spend all day doing exploratory bike ride with [John Pollock](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~pollock) in [Reddington Pass](http://www.virtualtucsonmagazine.com/vtmsections/oasispages/tqvfalls.html) area.

> (3) Get up really early, go on exploratory ride, *then* go to office and pursue option (1).

[I chose (3)](http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/reddington-pass-sm.html). What do you think?
