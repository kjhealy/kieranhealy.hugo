I picked up Alan Bennett's new collection, [Untold Stories](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374281033/ref=nosim/kieranhealysw-20) over the weekend. It looks as though it is at least as good as [Writing Home](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312422571/ref=nosim/kieranhealysw-20). The prose is—well, here's an example from the diary entries:

> I'm sent a complimentary (*sic*) copy of Waterstone's Literary Diary which records the birthdays of various contemporary figures in the world of letters. Here is Dennis Potter on 17 May, Michael Frayn on 8 September, Edna O'Brien on 15 December, and so naturally I turn to my own birthday. May 9 is blank except for the note: 'The first British self-service launderette is opened on Queensway, London 1949.

This is just Bennett being the Woody Allen of Leeds, but there's a lot more to him than this. Well worth your time.
