I've only seen the headlines, but I expect all the clowns put on their clown suits this morning and are presently climbing out of their clown car at the studio. I'm thinking liberal, activist, Puerto Rico isn't even a state and the Bronx isn't either, law-into-her-own-hands, affirmative action, closeted lesbian, the guy in front of me at Dunkin D's said she wasn't too bright. On that last point, it's well known amongst alums that whereas the Princeton Sam Alito graduated from in 1972 was a bastion of civilized learning, the Princeton Sotomayor graduated *summa cum laude* from four or five years later was a hippie "learning cooperative" where minorities got a coupon book of "A" grades upon admission to use up as needed, were all given the [Pyne Prize](http://www.google.com/search?q=pyne+prize+princeton) automatically, and the concept of truth was rigorously suppressed by the leftist faculty.
