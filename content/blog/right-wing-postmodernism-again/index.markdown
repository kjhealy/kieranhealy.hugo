While we're over at John Quiggin's blog, we can add [another example](http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/03_08_31_corner-archive.asp#013076) to his discussion of [right-wing postmodernism](http://mentalspace.ranters.net/quiggin/archives/001225.html). (Thanks to [Kevin Drum](http://www.calpundit.com/archives/002100.html) for having the fortitude to read the *Corner*.)
