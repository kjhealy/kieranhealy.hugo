Here are some comments from [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2006/10/estimate_of_ira.html) on the [Burnham et al. paper](http://www.thelancet.com/webfiles/images/journals/lancet/s0140673606694919.pdf). People who'd like (or ought) to learn more about statistics could do worse than read Gelman and Nolan's terrific [Teaching Statistics: A Bag of Tricks](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198572247/ref=nosim/). I am slightly embarrassed to admit that I am awaiting the publication of Gelman and Hill's [Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/002-9644667-3828001/ref=nosim/) with a degree of anticipation that seems indecent (or unhealthy) to direct at a statistics textbook. (More about the book [here](http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=052168689X). Note the blurb from a well-known blogger.)
