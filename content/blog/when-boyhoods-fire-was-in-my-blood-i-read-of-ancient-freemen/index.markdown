I just watched the [trailer for 300](http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/300/), a film version of a [Frank Miller graphic novel](http://www.amazon.com/300-Frank-Miller/dp/1569714029) (which I haven't read) about the battle of Thermopylae. Looks like the core of it is a good old relentless battle in the spirit of [Zulu](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008PC13/ref=nosim/). There's also some stuff on Sparta and its amazing toughness, Persia and its big golden thrones, and ambassadors to Sparta standing unwisely close to large open pits. The Spartan tradition of compulsory homosexuality was less in evidence in the trailer. My feeling is that the likes of Melanie Phillips, Christopher Hitchens and Victor Davis Hanson are already drafting the flinty Op-Ed pieces they'll publish the week the film comes out. They can add themselves to the [wide variety](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molon_Labe!) [of people](http://irelandsown.net/Nation.htm) [who have been](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Anthem_of_Colombia) inspired by the story of Thermopylae. It's all about juggling the analogy to make sure that you get to be one of the lonely 300, and not the vast invading foreign army.
