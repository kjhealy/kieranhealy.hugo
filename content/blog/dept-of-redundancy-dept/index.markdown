I've been moving house, so my apologies for the lack of content (as we used to say in those late-90s, Venture Capital days when CT was set to become a major portal/ bookseller/ search-engine/ content-provider … Ah, "content"—fungible like money, homogenous like lard, extrudable like sausage. A marvelous substance.) The other day our own [John and Belle](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/) suffered a [nasty double-meltdown](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2005/11/idied_update_pu.html) of their [computers](http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2005/11/idied.html). This prompted me to do something I should have done ages ago, which is set up an off-site backup system. Like John and Belle I'd previously relied on synchronizing my laptop and desktop machines (using [Unison](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/)). Properly backing-up your data can be a pain, but then so can losing everything. Thankfully, though, the Interwebs nowadays provide some useful and easy-to-use services in addition to all that content (consistency somewhere between Hellman's Mayonnaise and Cool-Whip; can be used as spackle if needed). So I've also signed up for a basic account with [Strongspace](http://www.strongspace.com/), part of Dean Allen et al's [Textdrive](http://textdrive.com/) outfit. With the assistance of a helpful tutorial from [MagpieBrain](http://www.magpiebrain.com/index) (Part [One](http://www.magpiebrain.com/archives/2005/10/29/strongspace_backup), Part [Two](http://www.magpiebrain.com/archives/2005/10/31/strongspace_and_ssh), Part [Three](http://www.magpiebrain.com/archives/2005/10/31/automated_backups)), I now have secure, automated, passwordless, daily remote backups of the important stuff on my Mac. Strongspace starts at eight bucks a month for just over 4GB of space (and unlimited bandwidth). I recommend it. (And they're not even paying me to endorse them.)
