[Radioshift](http://rogueamoeba.com/radioshift/) from Rogue Amoeba. Because I am addicted to listening to BBC Radio 4 and Radio 7 on my iPod before I go to sleep, I already use their [Audio Hijack Pro](http://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/) application to do effectively what this does, except more cumbersomely. This way you can subscribe to live radio broadcasts and treat them as if they were podcasts. Fantastic. Harry Brighouse take note.
