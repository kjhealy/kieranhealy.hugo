I'm [so far behind](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/11/10/deliberate-misrepresentation-of-the-facts/) on this one. Here's a figure based on a table [Eric](http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com) sent me.

![Composition of the workforce 1929-1939](https://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/NDworkforce-3cat.png)

There is a [PDF version](https://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/NDworkforce-3cat.pdf). There is also a [4-category version](https://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/NDworkforce-4cat.png) (with a [PDF](https://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/NDworkforce-4cat.pdf) too), that breaks out farm workers from the main category.
