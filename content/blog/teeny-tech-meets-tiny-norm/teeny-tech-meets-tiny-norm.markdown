**Scene**: In a parking lot, a few hours after renting a car for the week (much nicer than my regular car).

**Teeny Tech**: The car's headlights turn off by themselves about 30 seconds after you move away from the car.

**Tiny Norm**: If you see someone's left their lights on, you tell them.

**Teeny Tech meets Tiny Norm**:

> Helpful Person: "Hey, you left your lights on!"

> Me: "No, they go off by themselves."

> HP [looks slightly embarrassed]: "Oh. Sorry."

> Inside the mind of HP: "Well that's the last time I ever do that."
