Eugene Volokh [complains](http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2004_12_00.shtml#1101930018) that a recent draft of one his papers is missing something:

> Verve. "[Energy and enthusiasm](http://www.bartleby.com/61/30/V0073000.html) in the expression of ideas . . . . Vitality; liveliness." My writing was the usual lawyerese, flabby and clausy. The substance was getting there (though it still needs a lot of work), but it was missing vigor, concreteness, punch. So I've been doing Vervification Edits as part of my substantive editing passes.

"Verve" is a good word for the quality he's after, but I think "[brio](http://www.bartleby.com/61/57/B0485700.html)" is better, if only because its roots are mostly Italian and those people know how to live it up. In Jonathan Coe's terrific novel, *What a Carve Up* (published in the United States as [*The Winshaw Legacy*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679754059/ref=nosim/)) the narrator phones in a book review. Its chief complaint is that the book's author "lacks the necessary brio" to carry off the story. Unfortunately something goes wrong in the transcription and the published version claims that the author "lacks the necessary [biro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpoint_pen)," instead. Just as debilitating to the writing process, to be sure, but as a critical observation of character perhaps not so incisive.

I'm recovering from a bad cold, so I've been feeling a little short of brio myself. I have three papers to draft, a review to write and a book manuscript to revise (I sign the contract this week). So if anyone has any strategies for revivifying oneself, let me know in the comments.
