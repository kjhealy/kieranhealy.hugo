In the [news](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/news/archive/2003/06/16/national2006EDT0752.DTL "Customs, Border Patrol may upgrade protection with aerial drones") down here right now is a proposal to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border using unmanned aerial drones. Which gives rise to [this quote](http://www.sacbee.com/24hour/nation/story/918605p-6400604c.html):

> Robert Bonner, commissioner of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, told the House Select Committee on Homeland Security on Monday that it makes sense to conduct a pilot program using unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones.

A pilot program for drones. I love dead metaphors.
