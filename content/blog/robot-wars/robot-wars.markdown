[R. Robot is the robot pundit](http://www.inksyndicate.com/warbot/). He's a warbot. You feed him a name, and in short order he delivers a punchy column, laced with invective and cheap shots against the liberal blogger of your choice. Think Christopher Hitchens meets Ann Coulter in a software development environment. Here's what he did to that well-known PC Peacenik, Kieran Healy:

> **A modest proposal**
>
> by R. Robot
>
> The appeasing National Public Radio set makes reasonable political discourse impossible when they resort to spin and irrelevance every time Henry Kissinger says something accurate.
>
> One of the cunning Saddamphiles, Kieran Healy misrepresents Dick Cheney. "What ever happened to Osama Bin Laden?" he said. Oh, really? Now that's just contemptibly handwringing rationalizing.
>
> Refusing to stand behind the President, apologists would rather engage in contemptuously cynical insouciance as usual. "'Department of Homeland Security?' What the fuck is this, *Brazil*?" as Kieran Healy said last week.
>
> Kieran Healy, what kind of a man are you? The cunning liberals contemptibly believe that Prime Minister Blair is a more dangerous tyrant than the Buffalo Al Qaeda cell.
>
> Beyond Germany, it's difficult to identify any country where anti-Americanism is on the upswing.
>
> Pathological pundits like [Joe Conason](http://www.observer.com/pages/conason.asp) and others apparently believe the best way to confront Yassir Arafat is to give him a big, sloppy kiss.

Pretty harsh. You should see what he did to [Chris Bertram](http://junius.blogspot.com/2002_10_06_junius_archive.html), though.
