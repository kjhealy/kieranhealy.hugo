So checking the post today I found a letter addressed to my son, inviting him to apply for a Citibank Platinum Select Mastercard. Up to 40,000 American Airlines airmiles included! I've had a chat with the little guy about it (I still call him the little guyâ€”corny, I know, but other Dads will understand), and he won't be signing up, partly because it's a bad deal (18.24 percent variable rate, annual fee after the first year), but mostly because he is six and a half weeks old.
