Following up on [the one from the other day](http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000332.html#000332), here's [another great transcript](http://www.busybusybusy.com/b3_arc_03_0324_annex_2.shtml "Busy, Busy, Busy") of Aaron Brown interviewing someone, trying to push his own view via his questions, and then discovering he is losing the argument in a really embarrassing way. Hint to Aaron: if you want to strongarm interviewees, you need to have a strong arm.
