Dean Allen, of the incomparable [Textism](http://www.textism.com), has an entertaining rant up about the evils of [Quark Express](http://www.textism.com/article/713/) and its 90% market share. I hesitate to ask what he thinks of [LaTeX](http://www.tug.org/texshowcase/), the typesetting system I use to produce everything I write and one of the three applications I can't live without. (The other two are [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [R](http://www.r-project.org/).) LaTeX is very powerful, quite old, rather unfriendly and completely free. That about sums it up.

In another post, Dean notes that someone seems to have stolen his phrase ['Intellectual Property is Theft'](http://www.textism.com/article/714/), thereby confirming the truth of the aphorism.
