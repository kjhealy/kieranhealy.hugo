[Like Henry](http://crookedtimber.org/2008/04/08/street-politics/), I bought the [Old School Sesame Street](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UNYJTK/ref=nosim?tag=kieranhealysw-20&link_code=as3&creativeASIN=B000UNYJTK8&creative=373489&camp=211189) collection for, uh, my kids. Yeah, totally for them. There's all kinds of good stuff in there, including the God of the Classroom, [Roosevelt Franklin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf2nMSn9vW8). The improvised interactions with children who don't always do what they are supposed to are also great. For instance, here is a great moment where Paul Simon sings an short version of "Me and Julio Down by the School Yard." Slightly sour as always, Simon takes the song quite fast, as if he wants to just get it over with. He is immediately upstaged by the improvisations of the little girl sitting next to him. After he cuts her off, so he can start singing, she waits for her opening and then upstages him again. But by then even he is enjoying it.

And as an added bonus, [Here is Stevie Wonder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ul7X5js1vE) playing "Superstition" live on Sesame Street. Beats the shit out of Barney, I'm telling you.
