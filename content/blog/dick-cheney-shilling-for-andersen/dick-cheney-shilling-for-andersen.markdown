So a [promotional video](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/americas/newsid_2119000/2119981.stm) for Andersen Consulting dating from 1996 has popped up. It shows Dick Cheney extolling his close relationship with the firm. Best quote: "I get good advice, if you will, from their people, based upon how we are doing business and how we are operating, **over and above the normal, by-the-books auditing arrangement**."

You have to laugh. Otherwise, you'd have to cry.
