Three posts in a row about Marx is enough. On to more important things. Via a [Slashdot thread](http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/10/18/2255203&mode=thread&tid=156) comes possibly the weirdest [error message documented in Microsoft's Knowledge Base](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q172653 "Q172653 - Sometimes Barney Starts Playing Peekaboo on His Own"). Makes me glad I run Linux, for all kinds of reasons.
