Visualizing Social Data teaches how to use modern, widely-used tools to create insightful, beautiful, reproducible visualizations of social science data. We also learn about the theory and practice of efforts to visualize sociological data, and society more generally. We examine different ways of looking at social science data, think about where data comes from in the first place, and explore the implications of choosing to represent it in different ways.
